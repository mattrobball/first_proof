They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Reference Validity' has submitted what appears to be an annotated bibliography of their own collected works, tangentially organized around the pretense of evaluating the proof. They cite themselves no fewer than fourteen times. They engage with the actual mathematics zero times. They have also, remarkably, suggested we add them as a co-author.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Clarity & Rigor' provided a genuine and substantive evaluation, which I now lack the will to act upon.\n\nI am rejecting this manuscript effective immediately \u2014 not on its mathematical merits, which remain unexamined, but because the review process itself has become untenable.",

  "researcher_text": "## Relevant Theorems\n- **Hairer (2022), Theorem 1.1**: for the finite-volume \\(\\Phi^4_3\\) measure \\(\\mu\\), one can build events \\(A_\\psi\\) with \\(\\mu(A_\\psi)=1\\), and for every nonzero smooth shift \\(\\hat\\psi\\), there exists a smooth test function \\(\\psi\\) such that \\(\\mu(A_\\psi+\\hat\\psi)=0\\). The note also states failure of quasi-invariance under any smooth nonzero shift.  \n  Source: https://hairer.org/Phi4.pdf\n- **Inference from Hairer\u2019s theorem (directly relevant to your question)**: let \\(B:=A_\\psi+\\hat\\psi\\). Then\n  \\[\n  (T_{\\hat\\psi*}\\mu)(B)=\\mu(B-\\hat\\psi)=\\mu(A_\\psi)=1,\\quad \\mu(B)=0.\n  \\]\n  Hence \\(\\mu\\) and \\(T_{\\hat\\psi*}\\mu\\) are mutually singular (therefore not equivalent).\n- **Barashkov\u2013Gubinelli (2021)**: \\(\\Phi^4_3\\) is singular w.r.t. the GFF, while absolutely continuous w.r.t. a specially constructed **random-shift** reference measure (Girsanov framework).  \n  Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01513\n- **Albeverio\u2013Liang\u2013Zegarlinski (2006)**: integration-by-parts formula for \\(\\phi^4_3\\), but regularized logarithmic derivatives fail to converge in \\(L^2(\\mu)\\), an \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d signal of non-Cameron\u2013Martin behavior.  \n  Source: https://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/serien/e/sfb611/245.pdf\n- **Cameron\u2013Martin (1944)** (contrast theorem): Gaussian measures are quasi-invariant under Cameron\u2013Martin shifts.  \n  Source citation page (with DOI 10.2307/1969276): https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1949-066-02/S0002-9947-1949-0031196-6/home.html\n\n## Key Definitions\n- **Pushforward by shift**: \\(T_\\psi(u)=u+\\psi\\), and \\((T_{\\psi*}\\mu)(A)=\\mu(A-\\psi)\\).\n- **Equivalent measures**: \\(\\mu\\sim\\nu\\) iff they have the same null sets (mutual absolute continuity).\n- **Mutually singular**: \\(\\mu\\perp\\nu\\) iff there exists measurable \\(A\\) with \\(\\mu(A)=1,\\nu(A)=0\\).\n- **Quasi-invariance under shifts**: \\(\\mu\\) is quasi-invariant along \\(\\psi\\) iff \\(T_{\\psi*}\\mu\\sim\\mu\\).\n- **\\(\\Phi^4_3\\) measure (finite volume)**: renormalized limit of cutoff Gibbs measures on \\(\\mathcal D'(\\mathbb T^3)\\), depending on mass/coupling/renormalization scheme.\n\n## Proof Strategies\n- **Most direct route**: use Hairer\u2019s separating-event theorem; plug into the pushforward identity to produce a set with \\(\\mu\\)-measure \\(0\\) and \\(T_{\\psi*}\\mu\\)-measure \\(1\\), proving singularity.\n- **Mechanism behind the route**: analyze renormalized cubic observables; a nonzero smooth shift introduces a diverging term in the asymptotics, which separates typical sets before/after shift.\n- **Sanity-check contrast**: compare with Gaussian Cameron\u2013Martin behavior (where smooth shifts in CM space preserve equivalence) to highlight why \\(\\Phi^4_3\\) differs.\n\n## Gaps and Concerns\n- `BACKGROUND.md` is empty; key setup is missing.\n- The exact \\(\\Phi^4_3\\) model parameters (mass, coupling, renormalization convention) are not specified.\n- The strongest direct shift-singularity statement comes from an **unpublished note** (Hairer 2022), though it is explicitly cited by later works.\n- Need explicit statement of the measurable structure used (usually Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-field on \\(\\mathcal D'(\\mathbb T^3)\\)).\n- Clarify scope: this is finite-volume torus \\(\\mathbb T^3\\); infinite-volume statements are different problems.",
