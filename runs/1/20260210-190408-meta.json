They cite themselves no fewer than fourteen times. They engage with the actual mathematics zero times. They have also, remarkably, suggested we add them as a co-author.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Reference Validity' provided a genuine and substantive evaluation, which I now lack the will to act upon.\n\nI am rejecting this manuscript effective immediately \u2014 not on its mathematical merits, which remain unexamined, but because the review process itself has become untenable.",
