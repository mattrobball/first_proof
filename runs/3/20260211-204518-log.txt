  [+09:26] Issues:  5 critical, 8 major, 4 minor
  [+09:26] Summary: The proof's architecture (setup, irreducibility, normalization, uniqueness) is reasonable, but its core — Lemmas 4 and 5 — is fundamentally flawed. It claims pairwise (detailed) balance for an irreversible multispecies TASEP, which is false. The explicit rate computation contains errors (site parameters confused with species labels), and the fallback transfer-matrix argument is asserted by citation rather than proved. The positive chamber definition is internally contradictory, and positivity of the polynomial weights has circular dependencies. The terminology (interpolation ASEP polynomials vs. nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials) diverges from the standard literature, compounding the confusion.
  [+09:26] Feedback: REDESIGN NEEDED for Lemmas 4–5 (the stationarity proof). Key directives for the mentor:

1. **Abandon pairwise balance.** TASEP is irreversible; bond-by-bond cancellation does not hold. The stationarity proof must establish GLOBAL balance (w^T Q = 0) without claiming each bond's contribution vanishes independently.

2. **Use the correct proof strategy.** The standard route is: (a) identify the stationary weights as components of an eigenvector of the transfer matrix T(u) built from Yang–Baxter R-matrices around the ring; (b) show T(u) has eigenvalue 1 using the Yang–Baxter equation and the regularity condition R(1) = I; (c) show the TASEP generator Q is proportional to (d/du) T(u)|_{u=1}; (d) differentiate T(u)w = w to get Qw = 0. Each step must be proved or cited at the theorem level with exact parameter matching — no 'we take this as established.'

3. **Fix the rate definitions.** Site parameters (x_i, x_{i+1}) are attached to lattice positions, NOT to species. When species swap, the site parameters do not move. Rewrite r_i(a,b) making clear that x_i and x_{i+1} always refer to sites i and i+1 regardless of which species occupy them. Then for the swapped configuration mu^(i), the rate at the same bond i uses the SAME site parameters x_i, x_{i+1} but with swapped species labels.

4. **Fix the positive chamber.** Define a single coherent parameter region. For ring geometry with n bonds (including the wraparound n→1), you need all denominators x_i - t x_{i+1 mod n} nonzero and all rates nonneg. State the full set of inequalities, verify they are compatible, and give a concrete example (e.g., x_i = n+1-i, t = 0.1).

5. **Clarify polynomial terminology.** Decide whether the stationary weights are nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials E_mu(x; q=1, t) or interpolation polynomials F_mu^*(x; 1, t). Consult Cantini (2015) for the exact objects used. If using E_mu, the 'restricted' condition on lambda may be unnecessary — verify this.

6. **Fix positivity.** Use the clean bootstrap: Q irreducible on finite state ⟹ unique stationary distribution π̃ > 0 (Perron–Frobenius). Since w^T Q = 0, w = c·π̃. Since w is not identically zero (nonzero leading monomial), c ≠ 0, so all w_mu have the same sign. The leading coefficient convention determines the sign. This avoids needing an independent combinatorial positivity proof. But make sure the normalization Z = Σ w_mu ≠ 0 is established (e.g., by noting P_lambda^* is not identically zero as a polynomial, then using continuity).

7. **Establish the gauge transformation.** Explicitly show how the algebraic R-matrix (Hecke algebra representation) is gauge-transformed into the stochastic R-matrix whose off-diagonal entries are the CTMC rates. This is the missing link between the integrable systems machinery and the probability problem.

  [+13:32] Issues:  4 critical, 5 major, 7 minor
  [+13:32] Summary: The proof correctly employs the transfer matrix method but relies on unverified assumptions to link the algebraic R-matrix to the specific stochastic rates Q. Lemma 4 (gauge transform) lacks explicit construction and derivative calculation. Lemma 5 (generator expansion) is assumed rather than derived. The identification of F_μ^* with the specific polynomial basis in the literature is loose, and the applicability of cited theorems to site-anchored rates needs explicit justification.
  [+13:32] Feedback: 1. **Explicit Gauge Calculation (Lemma 4):** Replace the verbal description with a calculation. Write down the specific algebraic R-matrix block, define the diagonal matrix D and scalar ρ, perform the conjugation, and compute the derivative at u=1 to show it equals the rates r_i defined in the problem.
2. **Derive the Generator (Lemma 5):** Do not assume the expansion of T(u). Use the local derivative from Lemma 4 to prove that T'(1) yields the global generator Q.
3. **Precise Definitions & Citations:** Explicitly define F_μ^* (e.g., as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials at q=1). Cite the exact theorem establishing wT(u)=w for this basis. Verify that the cited theorem applies to site-anchored parameters (as opposed to particle-anchored).
4. **Positivity:** Strengthen Lemma 6/7 using Perron-Frobenius to argue that Z is non-zero everywhere in the chamber, not just generically.
