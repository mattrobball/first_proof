  [+49:14] Verdict: wrong_track
  [+49:14] Issues:  5 critical, 8 major, 5 minor
  [+49:14] Summary: The proof is incomplete and structurally incoherent. The probabilistic approach fails for dense graphs due to the dimension factor in matrix concentration bounds, a barrier the prover acknowledges but cannot overcome. The document also contains retracted arguments and abandoned attempts.
  [+49:14] Feedback: The current probabilistic strategy (random sampling with matrix Bernstein/MGF bounds) is fundamentally insufficient for the dense graph case due to the dimension dependence, which prevents proving the sharp linear size bound. You must abandon the naive random sampling approach for dense graphs and adopt a deterministic constructive technique, such as the BSS (Batson-Spielman-Srivastava) barrier method adapted for vertex selection, to avoid the dimension factor.

Additionally, the proof structure requires a complete overhaul:
1. Remove all abandoned attempts, including the failed moment method and the insufficient MGF derivations.
2. Present a single, linear argument (Definitions > Lemmas > Theorem).
3. Clearly distinguish between the sparse case (handled by independent sets) and the dense case (requiring the barrier method).
4. Do not claim the theorem is proven for 'all graphs' unless the dense case gap is rigorously closed.
