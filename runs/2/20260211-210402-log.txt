  [+13:16] Summary: The proof correctly identifies the JPSS unfolding and Kirillov model as the tools to use but fails in the technical execution of Lemma 4 (incorrect dimension reduction) and relies on an unproven and likely too strong claim about fixed-vector surjectivity.
  [+13:16] Feedback: The proof requires significant revision of Lemma 4 and the main logical structure regarding the choice of W.

1. **Lemma 4 (Analytic Correction):** The reduction to a one-variable Mellin transform is incorrect for n ≥ 2. You must analyze the integral over N_n \ G_n using the Iwasawa decomposition and the multivariable Kirillov model structure (see Reviewer 1).

2. **Lemma 4 (Algebraic Correction):** The claim that for *any* fixed W, the integrals generate the full ring C[q^s, q^{-s}] is not established. The 'linear combinations of shell indicators' argument fails because W may vanish on specific shells. You must either:
   (a) Prove rigorously that the image of Λ_W is an ideal containing a unit (derived from local non-vanishing of W), or
   (b) Weaken the claim to 'There exists a W...' and use a specific test vector (e.g., the newform) or vary both W and V as in standard JPSS theory (see Reviewers 2, 6, 12).

3. **Rigor & Citations:** Explicitly cite the JPSS theorems used for convergence, meromorphic continuation, and the polynomial nature of L(s)^{-1}. Clarify the definition of G_n and the action ρ(h).

  [+45:34] Issues:  3 critical, 6 major, 5 minor
  [+45:34] Summary: The proof strategy is sound, but the definitions of Whittaker functions are mathematically incorrect (missing equivariance), and the integral computation lacks necessary steps regarding domain reduction and phase cancellation. The existence of the test vectors also needs a concrete citation.
  [+45:34] Feedback: 1. **Fix Whittaker Definitions:** Redefine $W$ and $V_m$. They cannot be characteristic functions $\mathbf{1}_{N_n K_n}$ because they must satisfy $W(ng) = \psi^{-1}(n)W(g)$. Define them as functions supported on $N_n K_n$ that equal $1$ on $K_n$ (and transform correctly on $N_n$), verifying that this is well-defined (i.e., $\psi$ is trivial on $N_n \cap K_n$).
2. **Justify Existence:** Provide a precise citation (e.g., to Jacquet-Shalika or Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives) or argument justifying that the Kirillov model contains vectors with these specific restrictions.
3. **Expand Integral Calculation:** Explicitly reduce the integral from $N_n \backslash G_n$ to $K_n(m)$ (using $G_n = N_n K_n(0)$ and measure decomposition). Show explicitly that for $g \in K_n(m)$, the term $g_{nn}$ ensures $\psi(Q g_{nn})$ is constant, addressing the dependence on units.
4. **Verify Shift:** Briefly confirm that for $u(g,Q)$, the entries $(i, n+1)$ for $i < n$ do not affect the character $\psi$.

  [+55:43] Issues:  2 critical, 6 major, 7 minor
  [+55:43] Summary: Reviewers agree the global strategy is plausible, but the proof is not complete at the required rigor because the key fixed-first-variable surjectivity claim (Lemma 4) is not established cleanly: the argument includes abandoned routes, a sketch that effectively assumes what it needs to prove, and imprecise/mismatched citations. Additional issues include an unproved nonvanishing restriction claim for Φ_W, conflation of ideal generation with representability by a single integral value, an incorrect equivalence between nonvanishing meromorphic behavior and constancy, and inconsistent object definitions (image vs span vs ideal).
  [+55:43] Feedback: Keep the right-translation reduction, but rebuild the proof around one rigorous core lemma. Either (a) give a complete constructive fixed-W argument (Kirillov support on a single Cartan/Iwasawa stratum, explicit monomial extraction, then spanning), or (b) cite an exact theorem statement (number + hypotheses) that already proves fixed-first-variable surjectivity; otherwise the proof is circular. Remove exploratory/retracted Steps (iv)-(v), and either remove Lemma 6 or supply the full factorization needed for its character claim. Define once and use consistently: raw image set, R-span, and ideal (R=C[q^{±s}]); do not deduce existence of one pair (W,V) with Ψ=1 from ideal generation alone unless you prove representability. Correct the statement 'finite and nonzero for all s implies constant' (units c*q^{ms} are counterexamples) unless you add normalization that forces m=0. Add a citation matrix with precise source locations for each invoked fact (JPSS convergence/ideal structure, BZ Kirillov inclusion, and any mirabolic restriction/nonvanishing claim), and either fully complete the requested Iwasawa reduction or explicitly mark it as nonessential illustration.

  [+67:30] Issues:  2 critical, 5 major, 3 minor
  [+67:30] Summary: The proof architecture is correct and clean: right-translation reduction, fixed-W surjectivity, choice of V yielding Ψ=1. However, the central claim (A_π(W_Q)=R for fixed nonzero W_Q) is neither proved nor correctly cited — 'Theorem 2.7bis' does not exist in JPSS (1983), and Theorem 2.7 only gives joint surjectivity over all (W,V). Secondary issues include missing convergence/rationality justification, unstated linearity of V↦Ψ/L, unused definitions (S_π, J_π), and a phantom citation in the matrix. All issues are fixable within the current proof strategy.
  [+67:30] Feedback: You must fix the following before the proof can be accepted:

(1) CRITICAL — Prove fixed-W surjectivity as a new Lemma 4. State: 'For generic (Π,π) and any nonzero W′ ∈ W(Π,ψ⁻¹), the set {Ψ(s;W′,V)/L(s,Π×π) : V ∈ W(π,ψ)} equals R.' Prove it using Kirillov model theory: restrict W′ to the mirabolic embedding GL_n → GL_{n+1}; by BZ (Ann. Sci. ENS 1977, Thm 5.21), the Kirillov model of π contains C_c^∞(F^{n-1}\{0}); the resulting integral reduces to a Mellin transform on C_c^∞(F^×), which surjects onto C[q^s,q^{-s}]. Do NOT cite 'Theorem 2.7bis' — it does not exist.

(2) REQUIRED — Add convergence and rationality. Before introducing A_π(W_Q), state: 'By JPSS Prop. 2.3, Ψ(s;W_Q,V) converges absolutely for Re(s)≫0, admits meromorphic continuation as a rational function of q^{-s}, and Ψ(s;W_Q,V)/L(s,Π×π) ∈ R.'

(3) REQUIRED — State linearity. After defining A_π(W_Q), add: 'Since V↦Ψ(s;W_Q,V) is C-linear (by linearity of integration), A_π(W_Q) is a C-subspace of R.'

(4) REQUIRED — Remove unused definitions S_π(W_Q) and J_π(W_Q). They add clutter and are never referenced.

(5) REQUIRED — Restructure lemmas: Lemma 1 (right-translation), Lemma 2 (nonvanishing), Lemma 3 (JPSS ideal theorem — joint surjectivity, cited from Thm 2.7), Lemma 4 (fixed-W surjectivity, proved via Kirillov model), Lemma 5 (L⁻¹ ∈ C[q⁻ˢ]).

(6) REQUIRED — Fix the citation matrix: remove 'Theorem 2.7bis', cite Theorem 2.7 for joint surjectivity only, and attribute fixed-W surjectivity to your own Lemma 4 (proved from BZ Kirillov model theory).

  [+82:31] Issues:  2 critical, 5 major, 6 minor
  [+82:31] Summary: The draft’s high-level plan is plausible, but the proof fails at its core: Lemma 4 (fixed-W surjectivity) is not established and relies on a claimed descent to a one-variable Tate integral that reviewers identify as unjustified/incorrect in this GL_n x GL_{n+1} context. The steps asserting nonzero mirabolic restriction for arbitrary nonzero W' and surjectivity of the induced projection to C_c^infty(F^x) are also unproved, so the main conclusion Psi(...)=1 for fixed W is unsupported. Because this lemma is essential to the theorem, the current proof is not correct at graduate rigor. Additional issues (ideal-vs-set formulation, imprecise citations, and minor clarifications) are secondary and do not cure the central defect.
  [+82:31] Feedback: Redesign the core argument for fixed-first-variable surjectivity: either (A) cite and apply an exact theorem that for every nonzero W the normalized image {Psi(s;W,V)/L} equals R, with hypotheses/normalizations verified, or (B) switch to an explicit construction/nondegeneracy strategy (e.g., controlled test vector choice and direct computation) that proves existence of V and Q giving a nonzero constant integral. Remove the current one-variable Tate reduction unless you provide a complete correct descent with formulas and theorem support. Restate Lemma 3 in generated-ideal language, provide full JPSS/BZ bibliographic anchors with exact statements used, and patch minor rigor items (W_Q stability in Whittaker model, m in Z in Mellin generation, and the unused C-subspace remark).
