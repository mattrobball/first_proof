  [+13:13] Verdict: right_track
  [+13:13] Issues:  1 critical, 2 major, 6 minor
  [+13:13] Summary: The proof strategy is correct: use JPSS to produce a test vector making the unshifted integral identically 1, then right-translate to handle the shift u_Q. However, the critical step deducing a single pair (W_0,V) with Ψ=1 from ideal membership is unjustified as stated, notation R is overloaded (ring vs. right-translation), the key cancellation step is too compressed, and several citations are imprecise or phantom. All issues are fixable without changing the approach.
  [+13:13] Feedback: Fix the following issues in priority order:

1. **[Critical] Justify the test-vector step.** The JPSS ideal theorem says the collection of integrals {Ψ(s,W,V;I)} equals L(s,Π×π)·R as an R-module. When you conclude 1 ∈ L(s,Π×π)·R, you need to show this element is realized by a *single* integral Ψ(s,W_0,V;I) for some pair (W_0,V). Either: (a) observe that each integral Ψ(s,W,V;I) already lies in L(s,Π×π)·R and conversely that the ideal is the union of such rank-one contributions (so any element of the ideal, including 1, is a single integral for some pair), citing JPSS precisely; or (b) invoke an explicit test-vector theorem (e.g., work of Jacquet or Matringe) that directly gives a pair with the desired property. State the result you use as a lemma with a precise reference.

2. **[Major] Resolve notation collision.** R is used for both C[q^{-s},q^s] and the right-translation operator R(h). Rename the right-translation operator to ρ(h) throughout (including Lemma 3 statement and proof).

3. **[Major] Expand the cancellation step.** In the aligned display, add an intermediate line:
   = W_0(diag(g,1) u_Q · u_Q^{-1})   (substituting W(g') = W_0(g' u_Q^{-1}))
   = W_0(diag(g,1))                    (by cancellation)

4. **[Minor] Meromorphic continuation.** Replace the final sentence with: 'The meromorphic continuation of Ψ(s,W,V;u_Q) is identically 1, hence has no poles or zeros on C.'

5. **[Minor] Fix phantom citation.** Remove 'JPSS Prop 1.2' from Lemma 2's proof. Instead cite JPSS Thm 2.7 and state multiplicativity precisely (e.g., JPSS §9 or Cogdell's exposition).

6. **[Minor] Verify hypotheses in Lemma 1.** Add a sentence confirming Π and π satisfy the hypotheses of JPSS Thm 2.7 (generic, irreducible, admissible, over a non-archimedean local field).

7. **[Minor] Clarify JPSS vs. shift.** After establishing Ψ(s,W_0,V;I)=1, add a remark: 'The JPSS theorem characterizes the unshifted integrals. We now introduce the shift u_Q via right-translation invariance of the Whittaker model.'

8. **[Minor] LaTeX fix.** Replace \diag with \operatorname{diag} throughout, or add \DeclareMathOperator{\diag}{diag} at the top.

  [+19:04] Issues:  2 critical, 4 major, 5 minor
  [+19:04] Summary: The proof is on the correct overall approach, but it still has two blocking issues: (i) Step 4 currently uses the right-translation relation in the wrong direction, so the displayed substitution for the shifted integral is not valid as written, and (ii) Step 3/Lemma 1 relies on a stronger "single-pair realizes each ideal element" claim than standard ideal-generation unless an explicit test-vector theorem (or equivalent constructive argument) is supplied. Beyond that, reviewers identified fixable rigor issues: undefined/ambiguous conductor notation, imprecise citation for inverse-polynomial form of the local L-factor, missing explicit note that factor deletion preserves P(0)=1, implicit ring identification, unmentioned shifted convergence, and removing revision-style gap notes from the final standalone proof.
  [+19:04] Feedback: Revise Step 4 so the defining relation is W(x u_Q) = W0(x) (equivalently W = rho(u_Q^{-1})W0, or rho(u_Q)W = W0), then deduce directly W(diag(g,1)u_Q)=W0(diag(g,1)) and hence Psi(s,W,V;u_Q)=Psi(s,W0,V;I)=1. In Step 3, replace the current JPSS interpretation with a fully justified single-pair existence statement: either cite an explicit local test-vector result giving one pair with Psi(...;I)=1 (or at least =L(s,Pi x pi) plus a justified way to realize multiplication by Laurent polynomials within one pair), or provide that construction carefully. Clean up rigor points: define conductor as p^c and Q by Q o = p^{-c} (or Q=varpi^{-c}) to avoid q/qq ambiguity; cite JPSS Prop. 1.2 / Thm. 2.7 for inverse-polynomial form; explicitly state each linear factor equals 1 at X=0 so any subproduct still has P(0)=1; state R = C[q^{-s},q^s] is identified with C[X,X^{-1}] via X=q^{-s}; note shifted and unshifted integrals share convergence in Re(s)>>0; and keep the conclusion as meromorphic continuation identically 1 (holomorphic/nonzero on C). Remove the Gap Closure Notes section from the final submission.

  [+24:59] Verdict: right_track
  [+24:59] Issues:  2 major, 7 minor
  [+24:59] Summary: The proof strategy is correct and nearly complete. The central gap is the unjustified collapse from an R-linear combination of zeta integrals to a single pair (W_0,V) realizing the integral identically equal to 1 (flagged by two independent reviewers). All other issues are minor: notational clarifications (generic characters, invertibility of u_Q, genericity hypothesis), an imprecise JPSS citation (Prop. 1.2 vs. Section 2), and expository improvements (shifted integral is literally the unshifted integral, the argument works for arbitrary h, identity Ψ(s,W,V;h)=Ψ(s,ρ(h)W,V;I)).
  [+24:59] Feedback: Fix the following, in priority order:

1. **[Critical] Single-pair realization (Lemma 2 and main proof).** You must justify how 1 ∈ I(Π,π) = L·R yields a single pair (W₀,V) with Ψ(s,W₀,V;I) ≡ 1. Two approaches:
   (a) *Absorption argument*: Note that Ψ is bilinear in W (for fixed V), that summing Whittaker functions W₁+W₂ stays in the Whittaker model, and that multiplication by q^{-ks} corresponds to replacing W(g) with W(diag(ϖ^k,…,ϖ^k,1)·g) (i.e., right-translating by a central-type element). Thus any R-linear combination of integrals is itself a single integral with a modified W. State this as a sub-lemma.
   (b) *Direct JPSS route*: JPSS Thm 2.7 says the fractional ideal is generated by single integrals. Since 1 = L · L⁻¹ and L⁻¹ = P(q^{-s}) ∈ R, and L is realized by some single integral Ψ(s,W₁,V₁;I), the product P(q^{-s})·Ψ(s,W₁,V₁;I) is again a single integral (by the absorption mechanism above), equaling 1.
   Either way, make the mechanism explicit.

2. **[Minor] Lemma 3 simplification.** After substituting W(diag(g,1)u_Q) = W₀(diag(g,1)), the integral Ψ(s,W,V;u_Q) has literally the same integrand as Ψ(s,W₀,V;I). State that they are the same integral — no separate meromorphic continuation argument is needed.

3. **[Minor] Insert the identity Ψ(s,W,V;h) = Ψ(s,ρ(h)W,V;I_{n+1}).** Place this right after defining Ψ for general h. This makes all convergence/continuation claims for h ≠ I immediate from the h = I case (JPSS).

4. **[Minor] Invertibility of u_Q.** After defining u_Q, add: 'Since u_Q is upper unitriangular, det(u_Q) = 1 and u_Q⁻¹ = I_{n+1} − QE_{n,n+1}.'

5. **[Minor] Flag genericity.** Where you first invoke Whittaker models and JPSS, add: 'Since Π and π are generic, they admit unique Whittaker models (Shalika / Gelfand–Kazhdan), and the JPSS zeta-integral theory applies.'

6. **[Minor] Define generic characters.** Explicitly define ψ_{n+1}(u) = ψ(u_{12}+⋯+u_{n,n+1}) and ψ_n similarly, then write W(Π,ψ_{n+1}⁻¹), W(π,ψ_n).

7. **[Minor] Correct citation.** Replace 'JPSS Prop. 1.2' with 'JPSS 1983, §2 / Theorem 2.7' for the inverse-polynomial form of L(s,Π×π).

8. **[Minor] Note generality in h.** Before specializing to u_Q, remark that the construction works for any h ∈ G_{n+1}, and you are specializing to h = u_Q as required by the problem.

  [+31:36] Verdict: right_track
  [+31:36] Issues:  2 critical, 4 major, 7 minor
  [+31:36] Summary: The proof’s macro-structure is plausible (reduce the shifted integral to the standard one via right translation and then normalize), but the decisive normalization step is not established rigorously. In Lemma 4, the argument conflates the fractional ideal generated by zeta integrals with the set of single-pair integrals, includes abandoned/incorrect computations, and lacks a precise theorem that guarantees the claimed single-pair realization of 1 (or even of L) under the stated generality. Additional issues are mostly repairable citation/rigor problems: incorrect Godement–Jacquet attribution, imprecise multiplicity-one reference, uncited auxiliary claims, and small missing compatibility remarks.
  [+31:36] Feedback: Rewrite Lemma 4 from scratch and use exactly one valid mechanism. Either: (A) prove a fixed-V absorption sublemma with a complete, cited Kirillov/mirabolic argument showing q^{-ks}·Psi(s,W,V;I)=Psi(s,W_k,V;I) (same V), then combine with a correctly cited theorem that provides a single pair realizing L(s); or (B) cite a precise test-vector theorem (author/year/theorem number, exact hypotheses) that directly yields a single pair giving the needed normalization and avoid the absorption derivation. Do not claim that JPSS Theorem 2.7 implies the set of single integrals is itself an ideal unless you provide the exact statement proving that. Remove all abandoned in-text derivations and the incorrect claim about adding terms with different V’s; keep linearity only in one variable at a time with V fixed. Fix references and conventions: replace the Godement–Jacquet attribution with Bernstein–Zelevinsky/JPSS proof references; separate existence (genericity) from uniqueness (multiplicity one) with precise citation; add the sentence psi_{n+1}|_{N_n}=psi_n for well-definedness on N_n\G_n; add a brief conductor-normalization remark for psi in JPSS; remove uncited auxiliary claims (degree bound/supercuspidal P=1) unless fully referenced.
