  [+11:15] Summary: The proof architecture is correct: translating W by u_Q to ensure non-vanishing, then using the Kirillov model to construct a test vector yielding a monomial zeta integral. However, Lemma 3's base case has a critical justification gap — the Kirillov model construction of V_0 is asserted without stating the precise theorem (BZ compact induction isomorphism), the compact open subgroup J is incorrectly intersected with the closed subgroup P_n, and the reduction of the integral to a constant times a volume omits essential measure-theoretic steps. Several minor issues (unused conductor hypothesis, missing G_n-module remark, notation ambiguity) also need one-line fixes.
  [+11:15] Feedback: Focus revisions on Lemma 3, base case. Specific fixes required:

1. **State the Kirillov model theorem explicitly.** Before Lemma 3, add a sub-lemma: the restriction W(π,ψ)|_{P_n} is isomorphic to c-Ind_{N_n}^{P_n} ψ (cite Bernstein–Zelevinsky or Gel'fand–Kazhdan). This is the engine that produces V_0 — it must be on the page.

2. **Fix the construction of J.** Drop the intersection with P_n. Define J as a compact open subgroup of G_n (e.g., J = I_n + ϖ^r M_n(𝔬) for r large). Choose r large enough that (a) F is constant on J (smoothness of W'), (b) |det j| = 1 for j ∈ J, and (c) ψ is trivial on N_n ∩ J (smoothness of ψ — state this explicitly). Then V_0 is constructed as the image of the characteristic function of the compact open set (N_n ∩ J)\J in N_n\P_n under the BZ isomorphism, scaled so V_0(I_n) ≠ 0.

3. **Justify the integral computation.** Explicitly identify N_n\N_nJ ≅ (N_n ∩ J)\J. Show that on this set: F(nj) = ψ^{-1}(n)F(I_n) (using constancy on J and triviality of ψ on N_n ∩ J), V_0(nj) = ψ(n) (by construction), and |det(nj)| = 1. Conclude the integrand is the constant F(I_n)·V_0(I_n) and the integral equals this constant times vol((N_n ∩ J)\J) > 0.

4. **Minor fixes (one-liners):**
   (a) After defining V = ρ(g_0^{-1})V_0, add: 'Since W(π,ψ) carries the representation π by right translation, V ∈ W(π,ψ).'
   (b) In the change-of-variable step, note: 'The quotient measure on N_n\G_n is right G_n-invariant (since right Haar measure descends and N_n is unimodular).'
   (c) Add a remark that the argument uses only Q ∈ F×; the conductor-specific choice Q = ϖ^{-c(π)} is conventional (relevant for ε-factors) but not needed for the non-vanishing result.
   (d) At the top, define ψ_{N_m}(u) = ψ(Σ u_{i,i+1}) once and distinguish it from the additive character ψ on F throughout.

  [+20:49] Summary: The proof strategy is sound, but the Sub-lemma incorrectly claims the Kirillov restriction is an isomorphism for all generic representations (it is only an inclusion for the Schwartz space in general). This must be corrected to 'contains'. Additionally, the support of the test vector V_0 on the full group G_n versus the mirabolic P_n needs explicit handling to justify the integration steps, and notation for the field and function should be distinct.
  [+20:49] Feedback: 1. **Correct the Sub-lemma:** The restriction of the Whittaker model to $P_n$ is not an isomorphism to $c\text{-}\mathrm{Ind}_{N_n}^{P_n}\psi_{N_n}$ for general generic representations (only for supercuspidal). Change the statement to say the model **contains** this space. This is sufficient for your construction.
2. **Rigorous Support Argument:** In Lemma 3, explicitly state that you choose $V_0$ from this subspace (functions with compact support mod $N_n$ in $P_n$). Explain that extending $V_0$ by zero to $G_n$ is valid (as $P_n$ is open) and justifies restricting the integral from $N_n \backslash G_n$ to $N_n \backslash P_n$.
3. **Notation:** Rename the function $F(g)$ to $\Phi(g)$ or similar to avoid confusion with the field $F$.
4. **Minor Cleanups:** Ensure consistent usage of $J$ vs $J_G$, and briefly note that the integral converges absolutely due to compact support.

  [+30:25] Summary: Lemma 3 contains a fatal error: the proof extends a function from P_n to G_n by zero and claims it lies in the Whittaker model of pi, but P_n is a closed codimension-n submanifold of G_n (not open), so this extension is either non-smooth or zero a.e., and in any case does not produce a Whittaker function. The claim that N_n \ P_n is open in N_n \ G_n is false. Consequently the integral computation — the crux of the proof — yields zero rather than a nonzero constant. This structural defect has persisted across loops and requires mentor-level redesign.
  [+30:25] Feedback: The core construction in Lemma 3 is invalid and needs a fundamentally different approach. Two viable strategies:

(Strategy A — Fix the Kirillov application) The Kirillov containment gives V in W(pi, psi) with V|_{P_n} = V_0. Use this V directly. The integral over N_n \ G_n then splits into contributions from N_n \ P_n and its complement. You must show either: (i) the complement contributes a polynomial in q^s, q^{-s} that does not cancel the nonzero constant from the P_n part at all s; or (ii) you can choose V (not just V_0) so that V has compact support mod N_n in G_n, making the complement contribution vanish. Approach (ii) requires a deeper result than bare Kirillov containment — investigate whether the Bernstein-Zelevinsky filtration or explicit newform theory provides such control.

(Strategy B — Use JPSS integral theory directly) Abandon the explicit test-vector construction. Instead cite JPSS (1983) Theorem 2.7: the fractional ideal generated by all I(s, W, V) as W, V vary equals L(s, Pi x pi) · C[q^s, q^{-s}]. Since L(s, Pi x pi)^{-1} is a polynomial in q^{-s}, there exist W, V making I(s, W, V) = L(s, Pi x pi), which is nonzero for all s (it is a rational function with no zeros). This gives nonvanishing directly without needing to produce an integral equal to a constant.

Additional fixes needed regardless of strategy:
1. Lemma 3 statement: require Phi to satisfy (N_n, psi^{-1})-equivariance, not just smoothness. Verify this for the Phi in the main proof (it follows from the Whittaker equivariance of W).
2. Cite the Kirillov model theorem precisely (Bernstein-Zelevinsky 1976 §5, or Cogdell's Fields Institute lectures Theorem 4.1).
3. Clarify the role of the conductor: the nonvanishing argument works for any Q in F^x; note that the specific choice is for compatibility with epsilon factors in the functional equation.
4. If using measure unfolding on locally profinite groups, cite the standard decomposition result.
