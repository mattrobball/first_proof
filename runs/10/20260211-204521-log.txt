  [+10:57] Issues:  4 major, 7 minor
  [+10:57] Summary: The proof uses the right overall strategy and most algebraic components are directionally correct, but it does not yet meet graduate-level rigor because key setup and consistency pieces are missing or flawed: the objective and normal equations are not stated upfront, RHS definitions are inconsistent (full tensor vs masked observed data; B = TZ vs B = T_(k)Z), and Lemma 6 contains an incomplete derivation plus a nonstandard/incorrect Chebyshev bound expression. The preconditioner-quality discussion is currently heuristic without formal assumptions or proof. Remaining comments are presentation/consistency refinements rather than fundamental redesign.
  [+10:57] Feedback: Revise the proof in this order: (1) add a Problem Setup paragraph before Part 1 stating the masked regularized least-squares objective and derive Aw=b directly from its gradient; (2) standardize notation globally to mode-k unfolding T_(k), define observed-data masking explicitly (e.g., T_Omega = 1_Omega \odot T_(k)), and define B consistently as T_Omega Z so the sparse accumulation in Lemma 3 is exactly the stated object; (3) replace Lemma 6 with the textbook PCG result on \hat A = P^{-1/2}AP^{-1/2}, include the explicit error transform \hat e_m = P^{1/2}e_m, and use the standard minimax/Chebyshev identity 1/T_m((\lambda_max+\lambda_min)/(\lambda_max-\lambda_min)) <= 2((sqrt\kappa-1)/(sqrt\kappa+1))^m; remove the incorrect intermediate bound and incomplete display; (4) move preconditioner-quality claims to a clearly labeled heuristic remark unless you provide a formal sampling model and spectral-equivalence theorem; (5) make minor clarity fixes: remove += pseudocode from theorem claims, clean Part 3 complexity wording without unnecessary nr<=qr justification, and in Part 4 include the extra O(q(d-1)r) setup term when z_t are generated on-the-fly.

  [+18:20] Issues:  3 major, 5 minor
  [+18:20] Summary: The revised proof is mathematically correct with sound structure and complete coverage of all five claims. The remaining issues are confined to Lemma 6 (PCG convergence), where the PCG-to-CG equivalence needs justification and the exact-arithmetic hypothesis must be stated, plus several one-sentence completeness additions elsewhere (solution uniqueness, intermediate algebra, storage bounds, citation precision). No structural or correctness problems remain.
  [+18:20] Feedback: Address the following in the next revision:

1. **Lemma 6 — PCG/CG equivalence (major).** Either (a) add a proof sketch showing that the PCG recurrences (with preconditioner P) map to standard CG recurrences under the substitution ŵ = P^{1/2}w, or (b) provide a single precise citation with full bibliographic details (author, title, edition, year, theorem/algorithm number). Option (b) is sufficient at graduate level. Suggested reference: Saad, Y., *Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems*, 2nd edition, SIAM, 2003, Algorithm 9.1 and the discussion preceding it.

2. **Lemma 6 — Exact-arithmetic hypothesis (major).** Add one sentence before the convergence bound stating explicitly that it holds in exact arithmetic. E.g.: 'In exact arithmetic, the preconditioned CG method satisfies the following error bound.'

3. **Lemma 6 — Precise citation (major).** Replace the current dual citation ('Saad ... Theorem 6.29, or Golub & Van Loan, §11.3') with one definitive reference including full bibliographic details and the specific theorem/equation number for the minimax Chebyshev bound used.

4. **Part 1 — Solution uniqueness (minor).** After concluding A is SPD, add: 'Since A is SPD, it is invertible, and the system Aw = b has a unique solution w* = A^{-1}b.'

5. **Lemma 6 — Intermediate algebra (minor).** Show the step: ((κ+1)/(κ−1))² − 1 = ((κ+1)² − (κ−1)²)/(κ−1)² = 4κ/(κ−1)², so √(x²−1) = 2√κ/(κ−1).

6. **Part 4/5 — Storage bounds (minor).** Add one sentence noting that all stored objects (Cholesky factors L_K ∈ ℝ^{n×n}, L_G ∈ ℝ^{r×r}, cached z_t vectors, working matrices) total O(n² + r² + qr + nr) storage, none of which is O(N).

7. **Notation — Vectorization bijection (minor).** Define the column-major bijection φ: [n]×[M] → [N] explicitly and write S's columns as e_{φ(i_t,m_t)}.

8. **Gap Closure Note 10 — Stability claim (minor).** Either remove the claim that Cholesky factorizations are 'numerically stable' or qualify it with a citation (e.g., Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed., SIAM, 2002, Theorem 10.3).

  [+24:22] Issues:  1 critical, 3 major, 6 minor
  [+24:22] Summary: The proof architecture is sound and most lemma proofs are rigorous. However, four issues block acceptance: (1) the citation 'Saad (2003), Theorem 9.4.12' appears to be a phantom reference — the CG Chebyshev bound lives in Chapter 6, not §9.4, undermining verifiability of the convergence argument; (2) the linear system Aw=b is presented without deriving it from an optimization objective, so the reader cannot verify correctness of A and b; (3) Lemma 3 defines B using the full tensor unfolding but computes it from observed entries only, without justifying the equivalence; (4) the symbol ⊙ is used for both Khatri-Rao and Hadamard products. Several minor issues (notation inconsistency in Part 2 vs Lemma 2, 'proof sketch' framing in Lemma 6, missing CG well-definedness justification, incomplete on-the-fly cost assumptions) also need attention.
  [+24:22] Feedback: Priority fixes for the prover:

1. **Add a Problem Formulation section before Part 1.** State the optimization objective explicitly, e.g., min_W (1/2) sum_{t=1}^q (y_t - <(KW)_{i_t,:}, z_t>)^2 + (λ/2) tr(W^T K W). Differentiate with respect to vec(W), set the gradient to zero, and identify the resulting normal equations Aw = b. This simultaneously resolves the missing derivation (Reviewer 2) and justifies why only observed entries appear in the RHS (Reviewer 1).

2. **Fix the Saad citation in Lemma 6.** Replace all references to 'Theorem 9.4.12' with the correct locations: cite §6.11.3 (or Theorem 6.29) for the CG Chebyshev/minimax convergence bound, and §9.2 (Algorithm 9.1 and surrounding development) for the PCG-to-CG equivalence. Include page numbers if possible. Also narrow the broad '§9.2–9.4' range in Step 1 to the specific sections used.

3. **Fix Lemma 6 Step 1 framing.** Replace 'We give a proof sketch following...' with a direct citation: 'By the equivalence established in Saad (2003, §9.2, Algorithm 9.1), PCG on (A, P) produces iterates satisfying w_m = P^{-1/2} ŵ_m and ||e_m||_A = ||ê_m||_{Â}. We therefore apply standard CG convergence theory to Â.'

4. **Resolve the ⊙ notation collision.** Use ∘ (or *) for the Hadamard product throughout the proof to distinguish it from the Khatri-Rao product ⊙ used in the problem setup. Add a note in the notation preamble.

5. **Fix Lemma 3 definition of B.** Define B as the observed-entry MTTKRP: B_{i,:} = sum_{t: i_t=i} y_t z_t^T, or equivalently B = (1_Ω ∘ T_{(k)})Z. Reference the objective function derivation to justify this.

6. **Minor fixes (all straightforward):**
   - In Part 2, step 2: change C_{i_t,:} += α_t z_t to C_{i_t,:} += α_t z_t^T to match Lemma 2.
   - In Lemma 2 statement: explicitly introduce V ∈ ℝ^{n×r} as an input.
   - In Part 3: add '(assuming multi-indices are stored with observations)' for the on-the-fly z_t cost.
   - In Part 1: append a sentence on CG search direction non-degeneracy, e.g., 'In exact arithmetic, CG search directions are nonzero and A-conjugate as long as the residual is nonzero (Saad, 2003, Proposition 6.6).'

  [+32:02] Verdict: right_track
  [+32:02] Issues:  3 major, 9 minor
  [+32:02] Summary: The proof correctly identifies the PCG approach and derives the matrix-free operations. However, it relies on an ambiguous definition of the unfolded tensor that conflates the full truth with the zero-filled observations, invalidating the masking algebra. The complexity bound is too loose for high-order tensors, and the convergence proof uses unnecessary inequalities. Minor notation issues regarding vector orientation and index uniqueness also need fixing.
  [+32:02] Feedback: 1. **Masking Definition:** Explicitly define $T_{(k)}$ (or a new symbol $Y_{\text{obs}}$) as the *zero-filled* matrix of observations (0 outside $\Omega$). The identity $\mathbf{1}_\Omega \circ T_{(k)} = T_{(k)}$ is false if $T_{(k)}$ contains unobserved truth.
2. **Convergence Derivation:** In Lemma 6, streamline the Chebyshev bound. Use the exact identity $\operatorname{arccosh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2-1})$ instead of an inequality, and remove the unused lower bound involving $\sqrt{x^2-1}/x$.
3. **Complexity Precision:** In Part 3, remove the loose uniform bound $O(nqr)$. State the cost as $O(qr + n^2r)$ for cached $z_t$, and explicitly note the $O(qdr)$ dependence if generating $z_t$ on the fly.
4. **Uniqueness Assumption:** Explicitly assume that observed index pairs $(i_t, m_t)$ are distinct. This is necessary for $S^\top S = I$ and $P_\Omega$ to be a projector.
5. **Vector Notation:** Define $z_t$ explicitly as a column vector ($z_t := Z_{m_t, :}^\top$) to match its usage in inner products and rank-1 updates.
6. **Citations:** Update the Saad citation for the PCG equivalence to the section text (e.g., §9.2.1) rather than the algorithm block.

  [+38:57] Issues:  5 major, 9 minor
  [+38:57] Summary: The proof's core mathematical content is sound: the SPD argument, matrix-free matvec via sampled accumulation, sparse RHS, Kronecker-factored preconditioner, and Chebyshev-based PCG convergence bound are all correctly argued. However, five major and nine minor issues remain. The most significant gaps are (a) the linear system Aw=b is never derived from an optimization objective, leaving the reader unable to verify correctness of the system itself, (b) the SPD claim is only proved for K≻0 while the theorem's scope implicitly includes K⪰0, (c) the masking-projector equivalence is asserted without proof, and (d) formal definitions inconsistently use T vs T_obs. These are expositional and scoping issues, not structural flaws — the proof strategy is correct and all fixes are achievable within the current framework.
  [+38:57] Feedback: Priority fixes (must address for acceptance at graduate rigor):

1. **Derive the linear system from the objective (Issues 6, 7).** Add a 'Problem Setup' section before Part 1 that: (a) states the regularized least-squares objective on observed entries with RKHS constraint A_k = KW, (b) differentiates with respect to w = vec(W), (c) sets the gradient to zero to obtain Aw = b, identifying A and b explicitly. This is 5–8 lines of displayed math and closes the largest self-containedness gap.

2. **Restrict scope to K≻0 or prove the PSD case (Issue 1).** The simplest fix: explicitly restrict the theorem to K≻0 (or K + εI with ε > 0 absorbed into the model) and state that the PSD case requires a reduced-space formulation that is outside scope. Do NOT leave the PSD alternative as an informal remark — either prove it or exclude it from the theorem statement.

3. **Prove the masking-projector equivalence (Issue 8).** Promote to a displayed sub-claim within Lemma 1: define S so column t is e_{(i_t-1)M + m_t}, show [SS^T u]_j = u_j if j ∈ Ω and 0 otherwise, conclude this equals entrywise masking by 1_Ω under column-major vectorization. Reference the distinct-observations assumption. This is 3 lines.

4. **Unify T/T_obs notation (Issues 2, 9).** In the formal definitions (not just clarifications), define B := T_obs Z and b = vec(KB). Update Lemma 3's statement to reference T_obs explicitly. Remove the ambiguous B = TZ.

5. **Formalize the distinct-observations assumption (Issues 3, 14).** Move from 'Clarification' to a numbered assumption in a formal Assumptions section. State: 'The observed index pairs (i_t, m_t) for t=1,...,q are distinct.' Reference this assumption explicitly in Lemma 1 (projector) and Lemma 2 (unique accumulation).

Secondary fixes (important for polish):

6. **Fix transpose typo in theorem statement (Issue 5).** Change C_{i_t,:} += α_t z_t to C_{i_t,:} += α_t z_t^T.

7. **Add z_t generation cost to setup complexity (Issue 4).** State: 'If z_t must be generated on-the-fly, setup adds O(q(d-1)r) for G_Ω formation and B computation.'

8. **Remove convergence derivation redundancy (Issue 10).** State the norm equivalence once in Lemma 6; in Part 5, simply invoke Lemma 6.

9. **Restate assumptions in-document (Issue 11).** Add a numbered Assumptions section before Part 1.

10. **Add scope disclaimer for κ (Issue 12).** After the convergence bound, add: 'Bounding κ in terms of problem parameters (q, n, r, λ, δ, spectra of K and Z) is outside the scope of this result; the contribution is the matrix-free algorithmic framework with standard PCG guarantees.'

11. **Fix Saad citation (Issue 13).** Change to 'Saad, Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems, Theorem 6.29 combined with §9.2 (preconditioned CG).'
