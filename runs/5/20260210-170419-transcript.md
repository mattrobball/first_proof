## Loop 1

### Statement Agent

## Definitions
- `Problem`: the target claim from `QUESTION.md`.
- `Background assumptions`: all facts explicitly listed in `BACKGROUND.md`.

## Formal Statement
Prove rigorously: # QUESTION.md

## Assumptions
- Use only assumptions stated in the provided files.
- Every inference in the final proof must be justified.

## Notation
- Reuse notation from the problem where available.

### Sketch Agent

## High-Level Strategy
1. Translate the question into explicit hypotheses and conclusions.
2. Decompose the target into lemmas that can be proved from background facts.
3. Assemble lemmas to conclude the formal statement.

## Key Lemmas
- Lemma A: setup and normalization.
- Lemma B: core transformation step.
- Lemma C: final implication.

## Dependency Graph
Lemma A -> Lemma B -> Lemma C -> Main theorem.

## Risky Steps
- Items to watch from editor: None.

### Prover Agent

## Complete Proof
We proceed by proving Lemmas A, B, and C, then conclude the theorem.
Each step uses only listed assumptions and previously proved lemmas.

## Lemma Proofs
- Lemma A: established by direct unpacking of assumptions.
- Lemma B: derived from Lemma A and background constraints.
- Lemma C: follows from Lemma B and the target implication form.

## Gap Closure Notes
Addressed editor feedback this loop: None.

### Editor Dispatch

**Reasoning:** Demo: assigning all perspectives to the first pool reviewer.

### Editor Decision

**Verdict: `right_track`**

**Summary:** The proof has the right approach but Lemma B needs a detailed derivation.

**Feedback (prover):** Provide a stepwise derivation for Lemma B. Break it into sub-claims and prove each from stated assumptions.
