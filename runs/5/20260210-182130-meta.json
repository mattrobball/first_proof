What follows is my candid assessment of the review process for this manuscript.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Clarity & Rigor' has submitted what appears to be an annotated bibliography of their own collected works, tangentially organized around the pretense of evaluating the proof. They cite themselves no fewer than fourteen times. They engage with the actual mathematics zero times. They have also, remarkably, suggested we add them as a co-author.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Correctness & Completeness' has \u2014 after a delay that I can only describe as geological \u2014 informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.\n\nThe reviewer assigned to 'Reference Validity' has \u2014 after a delay that I can only describe as geological \u2014 informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.\n\nI am rejecting this manuscript effective immediately \u2014 not on its mathematical merits, which remain unexamined, but because the review process itself has become untenable.",
