## Setup and notation
- Fix a **finite group** \(G\).
- For a subgroup \(H\le G\), write \(G/H\) for the left \(G\)-orbit.
- Let \(\mathrm{Sp}^G\) denote the genuine \(G\)-equivariant stable homotopy category (or its stable \(\infty\)-categorical enhancement).

## \(N_\infty\)-operads, admissible sets, and transfers
- A **\(G\)-operad** \(\mathcal{O}\) consists of \(G\times \Sigma_n\)-spaces \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) with equivariant operadic structure maps.
- An **\(N_\infty\)-operad** is a \(G\)-operad \(\mathcal{O}\) such that:
  1. \(\mathcal{O}(0)\) is \(G\)-contractible,
  2. \(\Sigma_n\) acts freely on \(\mathcal{O}(n)\),
  3. \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) is a universal space for a family of subgroups of \(G\times \Sigma_n\) containing all \(H\times\{1\}\).
- Associated to \(\mathcal{O}\) is an **indexing system** (equivalently, a collection of **\(\mathcal{O}\)-admissible finite \(H\)-sets** for each \(H\le G\)), encoding which multiplicative norms/transfers are permitted.

## Incomplete transfer system \(\mathcal{O}\)
- A **transfer system** on \(G\) is a relation \(\to\) on subgroups of \(G\) that:
  - is a partial order refining inclusion (\(K\to H \Rightarrow K\subseteq H\)),
  - is closed under conjugation and restriction in the standard sense used in the literature.
- A transfer system is **complete** if \(K\to H\) for every inclusion \(K\subseteq H\); otherwise it is **incomplete**.
- An incomplete transfer system can be extracted from an indexing system by declaring
  \[
  K \to H \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad (H/K)\ \text{is \(\mathcal{O}\)-admissible as an \(H\)-set}.
  \]
  In what follows, write \(\mathcal{O}\) for such an incomplete transfer system (or equivalently, the corresponding indexing system data).

## The \(G\)-equivariant stable category adapted to \(\mathcal{O}\)
- There is an **\(\mathcal{O}\)-stable category** \(\mathrm{Sp}^G_{\mathcal{O}}\) (an “incomplete” equivariant stable category) whose homotopy groups form **\(\mathcal{O}\)-Mackey functors**, i.e. Mackey functors with only the transfers dictated by \(\mathcal{O}\).
- Induction/adjunction properties hold in the expected Wirthmüller-style form only along \(\mathcal{O}\)-admissible orbits.

## Representation spheres and regular representations
- For \(H\le G\), let \(\rho_H\) denote the **real regular representation** of \(H\), of dimension \(|H|\).
- For a real \(H\)-representation \(V\), write \(S^V\) for its **representation sphere**.
- For \(H\le G\), the induced \(G\)-spectrum \(G_+\wedge_H S^V\) is a basic building block in slice filtrations.

## Slice cells (classical)
- A **slice cell of slice-dimension \(k\)** is a spectrum of the form
  - \(G_+\wedge_H S^{n\rho_H}\) with \(n|H|=k\), or
  - \(G_+\wedge_H S^{n\rho_H-1}\) with \(n|H|-1=k\).
- A **regular slice cell** is one of the form \(G_+\wedge_H S^{n\rho_H}\) only.
- Given \(k\in \mathbb{Z}\), let \(\tau_k\) (resp. \(\bar\tau_k\)) denote the **localizing subcategory** generated by slice cells (resp. regular slice cells) of slice-dimension \(\ge k\).

## The \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice filtration
- The **\(\mathcal{O}\)-slice filtration** is obtained by restricting the generating slice cells to those induced from subgroups/orbits compatible with \(\mathcal{O}\).
- Concretely, define **\(\mathcal{O}\)-slice cells** (resp. **\(\mathcal{O}\)-regular slice cells**) to be the same forms as above but only allowing \(H\le G\) such that the orbit \(G/H\) is \(\mathcal{O}\)-admissible (equivalently, \(H\to G\) in the transfer system).
- Let \(\tau_k^{\mathcal{O}}\) (resp. \(\bar\tau_k^{\mathcal{O}}\)) be the localizing subcategory of \(\mathrm{Sp}^G_{\mathcal{O}}\) generated by \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice cells (resp. \(\mathcal{O}\)-regular slice cells) of slice-dimension \(\ge k\).
- A spectrum \(X\) is **\(\mathcal{O}\)-slice \(\ge k\)** if \(X\in\tau_k^{\mathcal{O}}\) (or \(X\in\bar\tau_k^{\mathcal{O}}\) in the regular variant). The **\(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity** of \(X\) refers to the largest such \(k\) (when defined).

## Connective \(G\)-spectra
- A \(G\)-spectrum \(X\) is **connective** if its equivariant homotopy groups vanish in negative degrees, i.e.
  \[
  \pi_i^H(X)=0\quad\text{for all }H\le G\text{ and all }i<0.
  \]
  (Equivalent formulations depend on the chosen model, but the intent is “no negative-degree homotopy.”)

## Geometric fixed points
- For each subgroup \(H\le G\), the **geometric fixed point functor** \(\Phi^H\) is a functor from \(H\)-spectra (and by restriction, from \(G\)-spectra) to ordinary spectra.
- It is defined using isotropy separation: if \(\mathcal{P}\) is the family of proper subgroups of \(H\), then
  \[
  \Phi^H(X)\;\simeq\;\bigl(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{P}\wedge X\bigr)^H,
  \]
  where \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{P}\) is the cofiber of \(E\mathcal{P}_+\to S^0\) and a fibrant replacement may be inserted depending on the model.
- Intuition: \(\Phi^H\) “kills” contributions from proper subgroups and isolates the \(H\)-isotropy layer.
