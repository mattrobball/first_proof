Fix a finite group \(G\). Let \(\mathcal{O}\) denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an \(N_\infty\) operad.

1. Define the slice filtration on the \(G\)-equivariant stable category adapted to \(\mathcal{O}\).
2. State and prove a characterization of the \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity of a connective \(G\)-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.
