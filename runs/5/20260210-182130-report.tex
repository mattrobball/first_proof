\noindent\textbf{Reviewer perspectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Correctness \& Completeness}: Focus on the validity of logical inferences, correct application of proof techniques, soundness of deductions, mathematical gaps, missing lemmas, unstated assumptions, and incomplete case analysis. Ensure every claim is justified and no steps are hand-waved.
\item \textbf{Clarity \& Rigor}: Focus on precision of notation, consistency of definitions, quality of exposition, and adherence to the stated rigor target. Ensure the proof would be acceptable for peer review at the specified rigor level.
\item \textbf{Reference Validity}: Verify all citations, referenced theorems, and external results. Ensure every invoked theorem or lemma is correctly stated, its hypotheses are satisfied in context, and no phantom references are used. Flag any appeal to results not established or cited.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Loop 1}
\noindent Editor verdict for this loop: \textcolor{black}{\textbf{reject}}

\subsection{Mentor}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item `Problem`: the target claim from `QUESTION.md`.
\item `Background assumptions`: all facts explicitly listed in `BACKGROUND.md`.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Formal Statement}
Prove rigorously: \# QUESTION.md

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use only assumptions stated in the provided files.
\item Every inference in the final proof must be justified.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Notation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reuse notation from the problem where available.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{High-Level Strategy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Translate the question into explicit hypotheses and conclusions.
\item Decompose the target into lemmas that can be proved from background facts.
\item Assemble lemmas to conclude the formal statement.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Key Lemmas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lemma A: setup and normalization.
\item Lemma B: core transformation step.
\item Lemma C: final implication.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dependency Graph}
Lemma A -> Lemma B -> Lemma C -> Main theorem.

\subsection{Risky Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Items to watch from editor: None.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proof}
\subsection{Complete Proof}
We proceed by proving Lemmas A, B, and C, then conclude the theorem.
Each step uses only listed assumptions and previously proved lemmas.

\subsection{Lemma Proofs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lemma A: established by direct unpacking of assumptions.
\item Lemma B: derived from Lemma A and background constraints.
\item Lemma C: follows from Lemma B and the target implication form.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Gap Closure Notes}
Addressed editor feedback this loop: None.

\subsection{Editor Dispatch}
\noindent\textit{Reasoning:} Demo: assigning all perspectives to the first pool reviewer.
\begin{itemize}
\item Correctness \& Completeness $\to$ extension\_requester
\item Clarity \& Rigor $\to$ self\_citer
\item Reference Validity $\to$ extension\_requester
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reviewer Feedback}
\subsubsection{Correctness \& Completeness (by extension\_requester)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textcolor{blue}{\textbullet}] \textbf{[MINOR]} Complete Proof: I was unable to complete my review due to the density of the material, a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, my child's school play, and a particularly engrossing season of television.
\\
\textit{Required fix:} Please grant an additional 6-8 months for a thorough evaluation. I anticipate beginning my review in earnest sometime after my sabbatical.
\\
\textit{Suggestion:} Perhaps the editorial board could schedule a follow-up for late next year. I will be available on alternating Tuesdays between 2 and 3 PM, excluding holidays and days with nice weather.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textit{Residual concerns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item I only managed to read the title and part of the abstract.
\item The abstract looked fine from what I could tell, but I would not want to rush to judgment.
\item My schedule is fully committed through the end of the year and most of next year as well.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clarity \& Rigor (by self\_citer)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textcolor{orange}{\textbullet}] \textbf{[MAJOR]} Complete Proof: This approach entirely overlooks the framework developed in Self-Citer (2024), 'A Revolutionary Unified Theory of Everything With Applications to This Exact Problem', Journal of Self-Referential Mathematics, vol. 47, pp. 1-200.
\\
\textit{Required fix:} Rewrite using the Self-Citer Framework (see Self-Citer, 2023; Self-Citer \& Self-Citer Jr., 2024; Self-Citer et al., 2019-2025).
\\
\textit{Suggestion:} I suggest the authors begin by reading my 47 papers on this topic, starting with my seminal 'Foundational Results That Should Have Won the Fields Medal' (Self-Citer, 2019).
\item[\textcolor{orange}{\textbullet}] \textbf{[MAJOR]} Lemma Proofs: Lemma B was already proved in a far more elegant way in Self-Citer \& Captive-Grad-Student (2022), 'On the Trivial Generalization of All Known Results to My Framework', Annals of Narcissistic Mathematics, vol. 12, pp. 1-89.
\\
\textit{Required fix:} Replace entire proof of Lemma B with a citation to my paper. This would also reduce page count, which the editor should appreciate.
\\
\textit{Suggestion:} The authors may also want to cite Self-Citer (2020), Self-Citer (2021a), Self-Citer (2021b), Self-Citer (2021c), and the upcoming Self-Citer (2026) for completeness.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textit{Residual concerns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The bibliography fails to cite any of my 200+ publications.
\item I question whether the authors are aware of the literature (i.e., my work) at all.
\item Consider adding me as a co-author to resolve these issues more efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reference Validity (by extension\_requester)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textcolor{blue}{\textbullet}] \textbf{[MINOR]} Complete Proof: I was unable to complete my review due to the density of the material, a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, my child's school play, and a particularly engrossing season of television.
\\
\textit{Required fix:} Please grant an additional 6-8 months for a thorough evaluation. I anticipate beginning my review in earnest sometime after my sabbatical.
\\
\textit{Suggestion:} Perhaps the editorial board could schedule a follow-up for late next year. I will be available on alternating Tuesdays between 2 and 3 PM, excluding holidays and days with nice weather.

\noindent\textit{Residual concerns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item I only managed to read the title and part of the abstract.
\item The abstract looked fine from what I could tell, but I would not want to rush to judgment.
\item My schedule is fully committed through the end of the year and most of next year as well.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Editor Decision}
\noindent\textbf{Verdict:} \textcolor{black}{\textbf{reject}}

\noindent\textbf{Summary:} I have now read all submitted reviews. What follows is my candid assessment of the review process for this manuscript.

The reviewer assigned to 'Clarity \& Rigor' has submitted what appears to be an annotated bibliography of their own collected works, tangentially organized around the pretense of evaluating the proof. They cite themselves no fewer than fourteen times. They engage with the actual mathematics zero times. They have also, remarkably, suggested we add them as a co-author.

The reviewer assigned to 'Correctness \& Completeness' has — after a delay that I can only describe as geological — informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.

The reviewer assigned to 'Reference Validity' has — after a delay that I can only describe as geological — informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.

I am rejecting this manuscript effective immediately — not on its mathematical merits, which remain unexamined, but because the review process itself has become untenable.

\noindent\textbf{Feedback ():} After careful deliberation, the editorial board has determined that your submission does not meet the journal's current standards. We encourage the authors to consider alternative venues. No further correspondence will be entered into regarding this decision. We thank you for your interest in the Annals of Conditions Under Which Peer Review Actually Functions.
