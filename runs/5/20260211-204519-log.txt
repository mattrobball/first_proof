  [+14:14] Verdict: wrong_track
  [+14:14] Issues:  6 critical, 5 major, 5 minor
  [+14:14] Summary: The proof strategy (forward via generators + closure, reverse via slice tower + detection) is the correct one, but the execution has critical errors throughout: the theorem statement changes between ceiling, real-valued, and floor connectivity three times; the double coset formula for geometric fixed points is applied incorrectly (missing the subconjugacy condition); Lemma 1's irregular cell case contains ~8 failed attempts before reaching the correct argument; the reverse direction is attempted multiple times across the main proof and Lemma 3 with abandoned strategies; the orthogonality criterion in Lemma 3 is too strong as stated; and detection/conservativity is used without proper cofiber arguments. The proof reads as an unedited working draft rather than a finished argument.
  [+14:14] Feedback: REDESIGN NEEDED — the strategy is sound but the proof must be rebuilt cleanly. Specific directives for the mentor:

1. **Fix the theorem statement first.** The correct bound is (floor(n/|H|) - 1)-connected, equivalently pi_k = 0 for all integers k < n/|H|. State this at the top and never deviate. Cite HHR Theorem 4.42.

2. **Fix the double coset formula in Lemma 1.** The correct formula for geometric fixed points of induced spectra is: Phi^H(G_+ wedge_K S^V) = wedge over [g] in H\G/K with H <= {}^gK of S^{dim(V^H)} (after appropriate conjugation). When H is NOT subconjugate to {}^gK, the contribution is contractible. This is critical — the current formula overcounts.

3. **Rewrite Lemma 1 (irregular cells) from scratch.** Present ONLY the successful argument: (a) compute fixed-point sphere dimension as m|K|/|L| - 1 where L = H cap {}^gK, (b) note m|K|/|L| is a positive integer >= ceil((n+1)/|H|), (c) verify ceil((n+1)/|H|) >= floor(n/|H|) + 1 by divisibility case analysis, (d) conclude. Delete all failed attempts.

4. **Redesign the reverse direction.** Use ONE clean argument structure: (a) Invoke the slice tower P^n -> X -> C_n, (b) Show Phi^H(q) = 0 using the connectivity gap between X's lower bound and C_n's upper bound (but do this via cofibers, not by asserting detection of zero maps directly), (c) Conclude q = 0 by conservativity applied to cofib(q), (d) Show the resulting summand Sigma^{-1}C_n = 0 by a correct range argument (handle the case floor(n/|H|) = floor((n-2)/|H|) explicitly).

5. **Fix Lemma 3.** The orthogonality criterion [C,X]_* = 0 for ALL degrees is too strong. Use the correct characterization: X in tau_n iff P^{n-1}(X) = 0, or use degree-specific vanishing. Cite a published criterion (Hill-Yarnall or Ullman).

6. **Choose one connectivity convention** ('d-connected means pi_k = 0 for k <= d') and use it everywhere.

7. **Add citations**: HHR Theorem 4.42 for the slice characterization, Blumberg-Hill for detection in Sp^G_O, Lewis-May-Steinberger or Schwede for the double coset formula.

  [+25:43] Verdict: right_track
  [+25:43] Issues:  2 critical, 5 major, 5 minor
  [+25:43] Summary: The proof has the correct overall architecture (forward: localizing subcategory containment; reverse: slice tower cofiber vanishing), but Lemma 3 contains a critical error — it incorrectly assumes spheres have no higher homotopy, invalidating the upper bound argument in the reverse direction. Additionally, the connectivity hypothesis is never explicitly used, several claims about Phi^H in the incomplete setting lack citations, and the characterization of C_n as generated by low-dimensional cells is asserted without justification. The minor issues (terse arguments, cleanup needed, missing remarks) are secondary but contribute to the proof falling short of the graduate rigor target.
  [+25:43] Feedback: Priority 1 — Fix Lemma 3 (critical): The current argument that pi_k(S^d) = 0 for k > d is wrong for spheres in general. Replace Lemma 3 entirely. Use the orthogonal/adjunction approach: C_n lies in (tau_n^O)^perp (this is the standard property of the slice tower cofiber — cite it precisely). Then for any admissible H and k with k|H| >= n, the slice cell G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H} lies in tau_n^O (it has dimension k|H| >= n), so [G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}, C_n]^G = 0. By the induction/geometric-fixed-point adjunction, this gives pi_k(Phi^H(C_n)) = 0. This avoids reasoning about sphere homotopy groups entirely.

Priority 2 — State where connectivity is used (major): At the start of the reverse direction, add: (a) 'Since X is connective, the O-slice tower for X converges [cite HHR16 §4 or Ullman for incomplete case].' (b) After showing all homotopy groups of Phi^H(C_n) vanish, note: 'Since X is connective and P^n X is connective (being in tau_n^O for n >= 0), C_n is bounded below. A spectrum that is bounded below with all homotopy groups zero is contractible.'

Priority 3 — Fix citations and justifications (major): (a) For the double coset formula in Lemma 1, state it in the exact form of your chosen reference and verify the indexing matches. (b) For Phi^H in Sp^G_O: explicitly argue that Phi^H descends to the localized category and preserves colimits there (use the universal property of reflective localization). (c) For joint conservativity: replace 'Assumption 4' with a precise citation (e.g., Blumberg-Hill for the incomplete case) and verify hypotheses are met.

Priority 4 — Clean up minor issues: (a) Remove the stream-of-consciousness parenthetical in Lemma 1 Case 2; consolidate to: 'For 0 <= r < |H|, we have 1 <= r+1 <= |H|, so ceil((n+1)/|H|) = q + ceil((r+1)/|H|) = q+1.' (b) In Lemma 2 extensions: write out the three-term exact sequence segment explicitly. (c) Add a remark that restriction to admissible subgroups is intrinsic: slice cells are indexed by admissible H, and equivalences in Sp^G_O are detected by {Phi^H : H in Sub_O(G)}. (d) In Lemma 1 Case 2, note that rho_K contains the trivial representation. (e) In Lemma 3, note that cell dimensions are integers when using j < n implies j <= n-1.
