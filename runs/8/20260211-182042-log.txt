  [+16:49] Summary: The proof contains fundamental topological and logical flaws in the smoothing construction. Reviewers 7 and 8 correctly identify that Lemma 3 fails for the 1-dimensional singular set (edges) because a local cutoff function cannot smooth a singularity extending to the boundary of the chart without creating discontinuities or retaining the singularity in the transition region. Consequently, the global patching argument (sequential composition of local isotopies) fails because the operations are not compatible on overlaps. Additionally, the proof neglects the 'exactly four faces' hypothesis, which is likely required to ensure the specific local singularity at the vertex admits a valid smoothing.
  [+16:49] Feedback: The current strategy of covering the singular set with charts and smoothing sequentially is invalid for connected singular sets (edges). You must redesign the proof using a **stratified smoothing approach**:

1.  **Smooth the 1-skeleton (edges) first:** Since edges are disjoint away from vertices, you can smooth them simultaneously (or consistently) using a global profile or compatible local models, avoiding the cutoff issue for non-compact singularities.
2.  **Smooth the vertices second:** Once the edges are smooth, the vertices become isolated singularities with smooth boundary conditions. You can then apply a local smoothing argument (like Lemma 3) to these isolated points.
3.  **Use the 4-valent hypothesis:** In the vertex step, explicitly model the generating function $S$ at a vertex where 4 faces meet. Show that this specific geometry ensures the existence of a smoothing (e.g., by ensuring the critical point is non-degenerate/Morse) that matches the smoothed edges.
4.  **Fix Technical Gaps:** Address the minor issues regarding distributional closedness (Reviewer 4) and the precise choice of the smoothing parameter $\varepsilon(t)$ (Reviewer 5).

  [+30:51] Issues:  2 critical, 5 major, 6 minor
  [+30:51] Summary: The manuscript has a plausible stratified smoothing strategy, but key correctness gaps are foundational at the current rigor target: the global reference-plane graph claim is false in general due to possible projection folding, the 4-valent vertex Morse-type classification is asserted without a complete proof or precise citation, and Hessian nondegeneracy during edge/vertex interpolation is not quantitatively controlled (mixed-derivative terms may create new singularities). Additional major reference-validity issues (weak Poincare step, smooth extension from annulus data, uncited mollification bounds) and smaller rigor issues (sign bookkeeping, embeddedness justification, t>0 regularity statement for Hamiltonians) remain.
  [+30:51] Feedback: Rebuild the proof around a local symplectic-chart atlas rather than one global projection: for each edge/vertex neighborhood, choose coordinates where the projection is injective and re-state Lemma 2 locally, then adjust the global assembly and overlap argument in Step 8 so local Hamiltonians are shown compatible on overlaps. Replace Lemma 4’s current assertion with either a full case analysis (including ray-matching constraints and degree computation) or a precise external classification theorem with hypotheses verified. Add explicit determinant-preservation estimates in Step 4 and Lemma 5: expand the full Hessian on transition regions, bound terms involving \nabla\chi and \nabla^2\chi (or redesign taper so these terms vanish/support is controlled), and impose explicit scale relations among epsilon(t), r(t), and any taper length L(t) guaranteeing det(\nabla^2 S_t) stays away from zero. Justify the existence of the smooth extension E with a cited extension theorem or explicit construction. Add exact references for the weak Poincare/de Rham result used for L^infty distributionally closed 1-forms and for the mollification error rates. Finally, patch minor rigor points: correct the sign step in integration-by-parts, add a compactness/tubular-neighborhood embeddedness argument for small t, and state explicitly that Hamiltonian smoothness is required only for each fixed t>0 (not at t=0).

  [+42:36] Issues:  6 critical, 12 major, 3 minor
  [+42:36] Summary: The generating-function approach to Lagrangian smoothing is architecturally sound, but the proof has critical gaps: (1) Lemma 6 (4-valent classification) is unproved and uncited, (2) the vertex interpolation determinant argument contains a false claim about error support, (3) the Hamiltonian compatibility argument is circular and ignores H^1 obstructions, and (4) five invoked lemmas (3, 5, 7, 8, 10) lack proofs. Additionally, the C^1 convergence claim is incorrect, Lemma 1 needs a genuine injectivity argument, and determinant non-degeneracy is conflated with the Lagrangian condition.
  [+42:36] Feedback: Priority fixes for the prover (address in this order):

1. **Lemma 6 (4-Valent Classification)**: Provide a complete proof. Enumerate configurations of 4 Lagrangian planes through the origin in R^4 up to Sp(4) equivalence. In the generating-function chart, these become 4 sectors in R^2 with quadratic germs S_i(q) = (1/2)q^T A_i q. The C^1 matching forces A_i to agree on shared edges. Classify all such configurations and prove the average (1/4)sum(A_i) is non-degenerate, giving the Morse model. If a literature citation exists (Arnold/Givental caustics classification), cite it with all hypotheses verified.

2. **Vertex interpolation (Step 4)**: The claim that E_{v,t} - Q_v is supported only near edges is FALSE — different sectors have different quadratics, so the difference is O(r^2) throughout. Fix this by performing interpolation sector-by-sector: within each sector, Q_v matches the sector's quadratic exactly, so Q_v - E_v is zero away from smoothed edges. Then the O(1) Hessian term from the cutoff is genuinely confined to an epsilon-strip. This requires a more delicate construction near sector boundaries.

3. **Hamiltonian assembly (Step 5)**: Rewrite non-circularly. (a) Show that d(-∂_t S_α) and d(-∂_t S_β) agree as 1-forms on K_t ∩ U_α ∩ U_β using the time derivative of the Lagrangian family and the fact that transition maps are time-independent. (b) Conclude the functions differ by c_{αβ}(t). (c) Show the Čech cocycle {c_{αβ}} is a coboundary — this requires addressing the topology of K. If K has genus ≥ 1, H^1(K,R) ≠ 0 and the cocycle may be nontrivial. Either add a hypothesis that K is a sphere, or prove the cocycle is trivial by construction (the smoothing of a fixed PL surface produces cohomologically trivial deformations).

4. **Missing lemma proofs**: Provide complete proofs for Lemmas 3, 5, 7, 8, 10:
   - Lemma 3 (distributional closedness): State explicitly. On each face, p dq is exact. Across an edge, tangential derivative of S agrees from both sides (C^1 continuity). Apply Stokes on each face to show distributional d vanishes. Cite Federer or Evans-Gariepy.
   - Lemma 5 (edge taper determinant): Compute the full 2D Hessian of S_{e,0} + χ_e · Δ_e with all product-rule cross terms. Bound each term: ∇χ_e ~ 1/L, ∇²χ_e ~ 1/L², Δ_e supported in |y| < ε. Show perturbation to determinant is O(ε/L + ε²/L²) < m_e/2.
   - Lemma 7 (annulus-to-disk extension): Use explicit radial polynomial interpolation or Seeley extension from the annulus boundary, with C² bounds stated in terms of annulus data.
   - Lemma 8 (vertex interpolation): Redo after fixing the sector-by-sector approach. Provide explicit sup-norm bounds for all mixed cutoff terms.
   - Lemma 10 (embeddedness stability): Use the compact embedded topological manifold's tubular neighborhood. For small t, K_t lies in this neighborhood and is locally a graph, hence globally injective by compactness. Cite Rourke-Sanderson or provide the argument.

5. **Lemma 1 (injectivity)**: After choosing coordinates so each face is a graph p = A_i q, argue that the C^1 regularity of S means the derivative is close to A_i on each sector. Since all four planes are full graphs over the same R^2, the projections don't overlap. Use compactness and local homeomorphism to get injectivity on a sufficiently small U.

6. **Convergence (Step 6)**: Replace the false C^1 convergence claim. The correct statement: S_{α,t} → S_{α,0} uniformly (C^0) with ||S_{α,t} - S_{α,0}||_{C^0} = O(ε²), and dS_{α,t} → dS_{α,0} pointwise a.e. (uniformly on compact subsets of face interiors). Hausdorff convergence of Graph(dS_{α,t}) follows from C^0 convergence of dS on each face plus bounded support of the modification.

7. **Determinant vs. Lagrangian**: Remove all statements equating det(∇²S) ≠ 0 with the Lagrangian condition. A graph of dS is Lagrangian regardless of Hessian determinant. If determinant bounds serve another purpose (e.g., controlling the topology of the interpolated surface or ensuring transversality), state that purpose explicitly.

8. **Notation**: Normalize notation at the start of the proof — declare chart maps, domains, overlap conventions, and use one symbol family consistently.

  [+55:13] Issues:  4 critical, 10 major, 5 minor
  [+55:13] Summary: The proof presents a plausible geometric strategy for Lagrangian smoothing (edge-mollification followed by vertex-sector blending) but suffers from a critical mathematical flaw in the classification of vertex singularities (Lemma 6). The argument that the topological degree of the gradient field is invariant under a symplectic shear which modifies the quadratic part of the potential is incorrect; such perturbations change the Morse index, invalidating the derivation of the nondegeneracy of the average matrix $\bar{A}$. Furthermore, the 'degree $\pm 1$' condition appears to be an unstated hypothesis. There are also significant gaps in the analysis: Lemma 8 assumes quantitative bounds on the difference term $D$ without derivation, Lemma 9 contains sign errors and a loose cohomology argument, and Lemma 10 requires a more rigorous topological argument for global injectivity.
  [+55:13] Feedback: 1. **Fix Lemma 6 (Critical):** The proof of nondegeneracy for $\bar{A}$ is invalid. The symplectic shear $(q,p) \mapsto (q, p - \bar{A}q)$ corresponds to adding $-\frac{1}{2}q^T \bar{A} q$ to the potential. This changes the Hessian at the origin and generally alters the topological degree (index) of the gradient field (e.g., turning a minimum into a saddle). You must replace this argument with a direct computation of the degree of the piecewise-linear gradient map $\nabla S$ on the sectors. Additionally, clarify if 'degree $\pm 1$' is a derived property or an assumption; if the latter, it must be added to the theorem statement.
2. **Derive Lemma 8 Bounds:** You must rigorously derive the bounds $\|D\|_\infty \lesssim \varepsilon^2$ and $\|\nabla D\|_\infty \lesssim \varepsilon$. Explicitly show that the stage-1 extension $E$ and the sector quadratic $Q$ agree to this order in the blending strips.
3. **Correct Lemma 9:** Fix the sign convention error regarding the deformation form and Hamiltonian flow. Provide a precise argument for why the cocycle $c_{\alpha\beta}$ vanishes (e.g., by defining the normalization at a base point and propagating).
4. **Strengthen Lemma 10:** Replace the loose degree argument with a standard topological proof: 'Since $\pi|_{K_t}$ is a proper local homeomorphism to a connected manifold $K$ and has degree 1, it is a 1-sheeted covering map, hence a homeomorphism.'
5. **Refine Lemma 1:** Explicitly use the fact that the link of a vertex in a topological surface is a circle to prove that the projected sectors have disjoint interiors.

  [+66:53] Issues:  4 critical, 7 major, 6 minor
  [+66:53] Summary: The submission follows the intended architecture (edge smoothing, vertex regularization, Hamiltonian gluing, embeddedness via small perturbation), but multiple central lemmas remain unproved or incorrect: the 4-sector classification/nondegenerate core argument is still incomplete, the vertex interpolation analysis has a critical second-derivative scaling failure, determinant nonvanishing is not shown for the blended main term, the Hamiltonian gluing has unresolved sign/cocycle issues, and the embeddedness proof uses an invalid varying-domain covering-degree shortcut. These issues affect the backbone of the argument, so the current strategy as implemented does not yet meet graduate-level correctness.
  [+66:53] Feedback: 1) Replace Lemma 6a/6b with a fully rigorous classification step: either cite a theorem that exactly covers 4-sector piecewise-quadratic Lagrangian germs with verified hypotheses, or give a complete explicit winding/degree computation on the link proving det(Abar) != 0. 2) Redesign Step 2 to eliminate the epsilon-angular-blend Hessian blow-up; use a construction with transition width proportional to radius (or avoid angular blending entirely), provide an explicit formula for Q_{v,t}, and prove uniform pointwise C^2 bounds. 3) Repair Lemma 8b by proving nonsingularity of the principal blended term itself (not only the cutoff remainder), e.g. by forcing E and Q to match on the blend collar or proving ||nabla^2(E-Q)|| is uniformly small there. 4) Fix Step 4/Lemma 9 with consistent sign convention (for omega = dq wedge dp, i_{(0,d sigma)} omega = -d sigma) and a rigorous global gluing argument via Cech normalization/path-independence on overlaps; do not rely on unproved inactive-overlap assumptions. 5) Replace Lemma 10 with a fixed-domain parametrization iota_t: Sigma -> R^4 and prove embedding for small t using C^1-small perturbation stability (immersion + quantitative injectivity), then recompute global convergence rates including vertex-core contributions (typically O(t^2) value, O(t) gradient). 6) Clean supporting lemmas/references: use an elementary W^{1,inf} primitive argument in Lemma 2 (instead of risky L^inf homotopy citation), cite a standard extension theorem appropriate for annuli in Lemma 7, and state explicit uniform chart/injectivity-radius choices used by the scale hierarchy.
