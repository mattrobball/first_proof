  [+07:56] Verdict: right_track
  [+07:56] Issues:  5 critical, 8 major, 4 minor
  [+07:56] Summary: The proof strategy is sound, but the execution relies on unjustified extensions of standard multiview theorems to the generalized setting (4 independent camera sets). Lemma 2 (Rigidity) contains flawed linear algebra in proving the uniqueness of the homography, and Lemma 1 lacks a valid proof or citation for the generalized variety. Additionally, the behavior of the tensor on repeated indices is mischaracterized, and the distinction between real and complex geometry is ignored.
  [+07:56] Feedback: 1. **Generalized vs. Standard Variety:** You define a 'Generalized Multiview Variety' with 4 independent camera sets but cite theorems (e.g., Aholt et al., standard reconstruction) that apply only to the standard single-camera-set case. You must explicitly prove that these properties (finite generation, reconstruction) extend to your generalized setting or provide a rigorous reduction to the standard case.
2. **Lemma 2 (Rigidity) Logic:** The linear algebra argument in Step 3 claiming H_1 = ... = H_4 is garbled. Provide a precise proof. For instance, use the determinant-preserver property: if det(XH_1, YH_2, Z, W) vanishes whenever det(X, Y, Z, W) vanishes (for generic Z, W), show this implies H_1 is proportional to H_2.
3. **Tensor Support:** The claim that Q_A vanishes for repeated view indices is incorrect (the determinant involves different rows). Restrict your argument to the support of pairwise distinct indices where the rank-1 condition is defined.
4. **Real vs. Complex:** Address the field of definition. Your use of the Nullstellensatz and surjectivity of the parametrization assumes an algebraically closed field. Either work over C and justify the descent to R, or explicitly handle the real algebraic geometry.
