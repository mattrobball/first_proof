The cleanest approach: adopt Huang's convention that the inequality holds for all real-rooted polynomials with 1/Phi_n = 0 when roots are repeated. Then the inequality reads 0 >= 0 + 0 (or similar), which is trivially true. No continuity argument is needed. If you prefer the perturbation approach, you must prove that J_n is continuous on the space of monic real-rooted polynomials (via continuity of roots as functions of coefficients plus the rational structure of Phi_n) and execute the epsilon-limit explicitly.\n\n2. **Simple roots of convolution:** Remove the 'except possibly for a measure-zero set' hedge. Instead, argue as follows: Huang's inequality applies to all real-rooted p, q. When p and q have simple roots, 1/Phi_n(p) > 0 and 1/Phi_n(q) > 0, so the RHS is strictly positive. The inequality then forces 1/Phi_n(p boxplus_n q) > 0, which means Phi_n(p boxplus_n q) is finite, which implies p boxplus_n q has simple roots. This is a *consequence* of the inequality, not a separate assumption.\n\n3. **Convolution normalization:** Add a short equivalence lemma. State Huang's definition of boxplus_n explicitly (his coefficient formula) alongside yours. Verify they agree by checking the k=1 and k=2 coefficients. If they differ by any combinatorial factor, propagate that factor through the inequality.\n\n4. **Clean up the p''/2p' identity:** Delete the 'Wait, actually' passage. Replace with: Write p(x) = (x - lambda_i) g_i(x) where g_i(x) = prod_{j != i}(x - lambda_j). Then p'(x) = g_i(x) + (x - lambda_i) g_i'(x), so p'(lambda_i) = g_i(lambda_i). And p''(x) = 2g_i'(x) + (x - lambda_i) g_i''(x), so p''(lambda_i) = 2g_i'(lambda_i). Therefore p''(lambda_i)/(2p'(lambda_i)) = g_i'(lambda_i)/g_i(lambda_i) = sum_{j != i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j).\n\nMinor: State equality conditions precisely ('Equality holds if and only if n = 2') or defer to a specific result in Huang.

  "researcher_text": "## Relevant Theorems\n\n1. **Finite free additive convolution \u2014 definition and real-rootedness (Marcus\u2013Spielman\u2013Srivastava).**\n   - A. W. Marcus, D. A. Spielman, N. Srivastava, *Finite free convolutions of polynomials*, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields **182** (2022), 807\u2013848 (arXiv:1504.00350).\n   - **Definition 1.1**: The finite free additive convolution $p \\boxplus_n q$ is defined by the coefficient rule $c_k = \\sum_{i+j=k} \\frac{(n-i)!(n-j)!}{n!(n-k)!} a_i b_j$. This matches the prompt's formula exactly (with $a_0 = b_0 = 1$ for monic polynomials).\n   - **Theorem 1.2** (matrix model identity): $p \\boxplus_n q$ equals the expected characteristic polynomial $\\mathbb{E}_U[\\det(xI - A - UBU^*)]$ where $A,B$ are diagonal matrices of roots and $U$ is Haar-distributed on $U(n)$. In the real-symmetric setting, $U$ specializes to Haar-distributed $Q \\in O(n)$ and $U^*$ becomes $Q^\\top$.\n   - **Theorem 1.4** (real-rootedness): If $p$ and $q$ are real-rooted monic polynomials of degree $n$, then $p \\boxplus_n q$ is real-rooted. (This is the interlacing families result; note it is Theorem 1.4, not 1.3, in the published version.)\n\n2. **Finite free Stam inequality (Huang).**\n   - H.-W. Huang, *Finite free convolution of polynomials*, Adv. Math. **403** (2022), Paper No. 108300 (arXiv:2009.03716).\n   - **Theorem 1.2**: For monic real-rooted polynomials $p, q$ of degree $n \\geq 2$ with simple roots, define the finite free Fisher information\n     $$\\varphi_n(p) := \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j}\\right)^2.$$\n     Then\n     $$\\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(p \\boxplus_n q)} \\geq \\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(p)} + \\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(q)}.$$\n   - **Hypotheses of Theorem 1.2**: The theorem requires $p$ and $q$ to have simple real roots. It does *not* require $p \\boxplus_n q$ to have simple roots as a hypothesis \u2014 simplicity of the output is a *consequence* (since the inequality forces $\\varphi_n(p \\boxplus_n q) < \\infty$ when $\\varphi_n(p), \\varphi_n(q) < \\infty$).\n   - **Convolution match**: Huang's $\\boxplus_n$ is defined identically to MSS Definition 1.1, which is the same as the prompt's coefficient formula (see Key Definitions below).\n\n3. **Root-derivative identity** (standard; e.g., Prasolov, *Polynomials*, Ch. 1):\n   For a degree-$n$ polynomial $p(x) = \\prod(x - \\lambda_i)$ with simple roots,\n   $$\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j} = \\frac{p''(\\lambda_i)}{2\\,p'(\\lambda_i)}.$$\n   Hence $\\Phi_n(p) = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_i (p''(\\lambda_i)/p'(\\lambda_i))^2$.\n\n4. **Continuity of polynomial roots** (standard; e.g., Ostrowski's theorem):\n   The roots of a monic polynomial depend continuously on its coefficients. This is used in the density/approximation argument for extending the inequality from simple-rooted to general real-rooted polynomials.\n\n## Key Definitions\n\n1. **Prompt's finite free convolution** ($\\boxplus_n$):\n   $$c_k = \\sum_{i+j=k} \\frac{(n-i)!(n-j)!}{n!(n-k)!} a_i b_j, \\quad k=0,\\ldots,n.$$\n   Note: $c_0 = \\frac{n!\\cdot n!}{n!\\cdot n!} a_0 b_0 = 1$, so $p \\boxplus_n q$ is monic.\n\n2. **Prompt's finite free Fisher information** ($\\Phi_n$):\n   $$\\Phi_n(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j}\\right)^2, \\qquad \\Phi_n(p) = \\infty \\text{ if } p \\text{ has a multiple root.}$$\n\n3. **Huang's finite free Fisher information** ($\\varphi_n$):\n   $$\\varphi_n(p) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\Phi_n(p).$$\n   **Explicit scaling relation**: $\\Phi_n(p) = n \\cdot \\varphi_n(p)$, where $n > 0$ depends only on the degree. This is a pure positive scalar multiple. The reciprocal inequality is invariant:\n   $$\\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(r)} \\geq \\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(p)} + \\frac{1}{\\varphi_n(q)} \\iff \\frac{n}{\\Phi_n(r)} \\geq \\frac{n}{\\Phi_n(p)} + \\frac{n}{\\Phi_n(q)} \\iff \\frac{1}{\\Phi_n(r)} \\geq \\frac{1}{\\Phi_n(p)} + \\frac{1}{\\Phi_n(q)}.$$\n\n4. **Reciprocal Fisher information**: $J_n(p) := 1/\\Phi_n(p)$ with $1/\\infty := 0$.\n\n5. **Low-order convolution coefficients** (used in variance/discriminant checks):\n   - $k=1$: $(i,j) \\in \\{(0,1),(1,0)\\}$. $c_1 = \\frac{n!(n-1)!}{n!(n-1)!}b_1 + \\frac{(n-1)!n!}{n!(n-1)!}a_1 = a_1 + b_1$.\n   - $k=2$: $(i,j) \\in \\{(0,2),(1,1),(2,0)\\}$. Prefactors: $(0,2)$: $\\frac{n!(n-2)!}{n!(n-2)!} = 1$; $(1,1)$: $\\frac{(n-1)!^2}{n!(n-2)!} = \\frac{n-1}{n}$; $(2,0)$: $1$. So $c_2 = a_2 + b_2 + \\frac{n-1}{n}a_1 b_1$.\n\n6. **Sign-convention dictionary** (MSS \u2194 prompt): MSS writes $p(x) = \\sum (-1)^i \\alpha_i x^{n-i}$, so $\\alpha_i = (-1)^i a_i$. Substituting into MSS's convolution formula and using $(-1)^i(-1)^j(-1)^k = 1$ for $i+j=k$ yields the prompt's formula identically.\n\n## Proof Strategies\n\n1. **Source-locked reduction (recommended)**:\n   - **Step A**: Cite MSS 2022 Def. 1.1 + Thm. 1.4 for real-rootedness. Verify monicness ($c_0=1$).\n   - **Step B**: State Huang 2022 Thm. 1.2 verbatim (imported theorem subsection). Show the notation dictionary: Huang's $\\varphi_n = \\Phi_n/n$. Since $n>0$ is degree-only, the reciprocal Stam inequality transfers directly.\n   - **Step C**: Apply to simple-rooted $p,q$ to get $J_n(p\\boxplus_n q) \\geq J_n(p) + J_n(q)$.\n   - **Step D**: Extend to all real-rooted inputs via density + upper semicontinuity of $J_n$ (Lemmas 5, 6 from prior loops).\n\n2. **Non-circular extension to repeated roots**:\n   - Approximate any real-rooted $p$ by simple-rooted $p_m(x) = \\prod(x - \\lambda_i - i/m)$.\n   - Coefficients of $p_m \\boxplus_n q_m$ converge to those of $p \\boxplus_n q$ (polynomial in coefficients).\n   - Upper semicontinuity of $J_n$: if $f_m \\to f$ coefficientwise, $J_n(f) \\geq \\limsup J_n(f_m)$. For the key collision case: take $s = \\min(I)$ where $I$ is a maximal multiplicity block; then all intra-block terms $1/(\\nu_s^{(m)} - \\nu_j^{(m)})$ for $j > s$ are negative, giving $A_m \\leq 1/(\\nu_s^{(m)} - \\nu_{s+1}^{(m)}) \\to -\\infty$, while the remainder $B_m$ from roots outside $I$ stays bounded.\n   - Pass to the limit: $J_n(r) \\geq \\limsup J_n(r_m) \\geq \\lim(J_n(p_m) + J_n(q_m)) = J_n(p) + J_n(q)$.\n\n3. **Explicit $n=2$ verification** (equality case):\n   $\\Phi_2(f) = 2/\\Delta_f$, $J_2(f) = \\Delta_f/2$. The discriminant is additive: $\\Delta_{p\\boxplus_2 q} = \\Delta_p + \\Delta_q$, giving $J_2(p\\boxplus_2 q) = J_2(p) + J_2(q)$.\n\n4. **Variance additivity** (supplementary/motivational, not logically required):\n   $\\mathrm{Var}(p\\boxplus_n q) = \\mathrm{Var}(p) + \\mathrm{Var}(q)$, proved from the $c_1, c_2$ formulas. This parallels the classical/free probability Stam inequality structure.\n\n## Gaps and Concerns\n\n1. **Citation verification**: The exact theorem number (Thm. 1.2) and paper details for Huang's result must be stated precisely. The paper is H.-W. Huang, *Finite free convolution of polynomials*, Adv. Math. **403** (2022), 108300 (arXiv:2009.03716). The prover must include the full title and verify the theorem number against the published version (numbering may differ between arXiv versions).\n\n2. **Hypothesis match for Huang Thm. 1.2**: The theorem requires simple roots of the *inputs* $p, q$ only. Simplicity of $p \\boxplus_n q$ is a consequence (since $J_n(p) + J_n(q) > 0$ forces $J_n(p\\boxplus_n q) > 0$, hence $\\Phi_n(p\\boxplus_n q) < \\infty$). This must be stated explicitly to avoid circularity.\n\n3. **MSS theorem numbering**: Real-rootedness is Theorem 1.4 in the published MSS paper, not 1.3. The matrix model identity is Theorem 1.2 (with Haar unitary $U$; specialize to orthogonal $Q$ and $Q^\\top$ for the real case). These numbers should be double-checked against the published version at Probab. Theory Relat. Fields **182** (2022).\n\n4. **Lemma 5 exhaustiveness**: The upper semicontinuity proof must explicitly handle: (a) $f$ simple-rooted \u2192 continuity; (b) $f$ has a repeated root \u2192 divergence argument with $s = \\min(I)$ clearly defined. If some $f_m$ themselves have repeated roots, $J_n(f_m) = 0 \\leq J_n(f)$ trivially, so these do not affect $\\limsup$.\n\n5. **Equality conditions**: The prompt asks \"Is it true that...?\" \u2014 answering \"yes\" with the inequality is sufficient. No characterization of equality for $n > 2$ is needed. The $n = 2$ equality is a useful sanity check but not required for the answer.\n\n6. **Scope**: The theorem should be stated for $n \\geq 2$. For $n = 1$, $\\Phi_1 = 0$ (empty sum), giving $1/0 \\geq 1/0 + 1/0$, which is degenerate. Exclude or handle separately with a one-line remark.",
