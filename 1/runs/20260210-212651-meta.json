Add a precise citation for Assumption 2: identify the specific paper (e.g., Hairer, 'Phi^4_3 is orthogonal to GFF', or the relevant result from regularity structures work), theorem number, and restate the theorem exactly as it appears in the source.\n2. Rewrite Assumption 2 with notation matching the source theorem. If the published result uses distinct symbols for the shift direction and test function, use those. Ensure the quantifier order is correct (e.g., 'for every nonzero smooth shift h, there exists...' vs. 'for every nonzero smooth psi, the set A_psi satisfies...').\n3. Add a short compatibility statement (or lemma) confirming that the finite-volume Phi^4_3 measure used here is the same object (or in the same measure class) as the one in the cited singularity theorem. Cite the construction paper(s).\n\n**Minor (should fix):**\n4. In Step 4, add an inline justification of $(A_\\psi + \\psi) - \\psi = A_\\psi$: e.g., '$v \\in (A_\\psi + \\psi) - \\psi$ iff $v + \\psi \\in A_\\psi + \\psi$ iff $v \\in A_\\psi$'.\n5. In Lemma 2, replace the change-of-variables framing with direct set-theoretic reasoning: '$\\{u \\in E : u + \\psi \\in B\\} = B - \\psi$ by definition of Minkowski difference with a singleton.'\n6. In Gap Closure Note 3, remove the parenthetical claim about Phi^4_2 quasi-invariance (or replace with a precise, cited statement about when quasi-invariance holds, e.g., for Gaussian measures in Cameron-Martin directions).\n7. For Lemmas 2 and 3, acknowledge these follow directly from the definitions provided in the problem setup rather than re-deriving from alternative formulations.\n8.
