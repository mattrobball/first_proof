The high-level strategy (Laplacian normalization, greedy coloring with potential barrier, pigeonhole extraction) is sound, and all key estimates check out. Reviewer findings are limited to missing routine justifications for true intermediate claims (the (I-K)^{-1} spectral bound, an algebraic rearrangement) and minor notational/presentation issues (variable collision, imprecise phrasing). No logical, computational, or conceptual errors were found. An expert referee would accept this proof after requesting minor expository revisions."
