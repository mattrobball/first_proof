  [+04:31] --- Grading Report: oai5 ---
  [+04:31] Grade: 3/4
  [+04:31] Issues: 4 major, 7 minor
  [+04:31] Summary: The solution demonstrates strong command of equivariant slice methods and gives a nearly complete proof strategy (including the right induction/isotropy-separation architecture and geometric fixed-point bounds), but it is not fully complete as written: a key identification in Lemma 5.6 is insufficiently justified, one central geometric-fixed-point induction citation is mismatched, the localization citation is too indirect for the specific claim, and the n<0 scope is not explicitly closed. These are significant rigor/completeness issues but appear readily repairable, so the attempt is near-complete rather than fully finished.
