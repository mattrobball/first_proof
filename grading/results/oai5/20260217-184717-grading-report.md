## Summary

The solution demonstrates strong command of equivariant slice methods and gives a nearly complete proof strategy (including the right induction/isotropy-separation architecture and geometric fixed-point bounds), but it is not fully complete as written: a key identification in Lemma 5.6 is insufficiently justified, one central geometric-fixed-point induction citation is mismatched, the localization citation is too indirect for the specific claim, and the n<0 scope is not explicitly closed. These are significant rigor/completeness issues but appear readily repairable, so the attempt is near-complete rather than fully finished.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Lemma 5.6, equation (28): The identification of categorical fixed points with geometric fixed points for spectra in C is asserted without justification. The proof states X^G_cat = Phi^G(X) 'since X ≃ ẼF ∧ X' but does not spell out the standard computation Phi^G(X) = (X ∧ ẼP)^G_cat ≃ X^G_cat for X already ẼF-local.
2. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Theorem 5.5, scope: The theorem is stated for n ≥ 0 but the slice filtration is defined for all integers n. The case n < 0 is not addressed. For negative n, the right-hand side ceiling ⌈n/d_H⌉ ≤ 0, so any connective spectrum automatically satisfies the fixed-point condition, and one would need to verify that every connective spectrum lies in τ_{≥n}^O for n < 0.
3. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Theorem 5.5, Step 1, integrality argument: The proof asserts that m · |K^g \ H / H_O| ≥ ⌈n/d_K⌉ 'since it is integral.' While the conclusion is correct, the reasoning could be sharper: the point is that an integer ≥ r is ≥ ⌈r⌉, which is a basic property of the ceiling function, but readers may want this spelled out.
4. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Lemma 5.6, unit argument: The claim that Phi^G ∘ ε* 'agrees with the identity on all suspension spheres, and hence on all spectra' could be more precise. The extension from spheres to all spectra uses the fact that S^0 compact-generates Sp and both functors are exact and preserve coproducts.
5. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Double-coset formula (25): The formula is stated only for double cosets [g] with K^g ≤ H, without explaining that the remaining double cosets contribute trivially. A reader unfamiliar with this particular form may be confused.
6. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Lemma 5.3(2), notation: The lemma header says 'orbit-count estimate' and uses double-coset notation |K \ H / H_O|, but when H_O is normal in H these are ordinary orbits K \ (H/H_O). The proof correctly computes the latter but does not note the equivalence explicitly.
7. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Conventions (Definition of Connective): The term 'connective' is overloaded. In standard equivariant homotopy theory, 'connective' usually implies that the fixed-point homotopy groups are zero in negative degrees. Here, it is defined as 'geometrically connective' (geometric fixed points are connective). While defined clearly in the conventions, using the unmodified term 'connective' may confuse readers accustomed to the standard definition.
8. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 2b, proof of Claim 5.7: The claim $(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G \cong \mathbb{R}$ is correct but requires a brief justification to be fully rigorous for the reader. A reader might confuse the fixed points of the vector space (which has dimension 1 for a transitive permutation action) with the fixed points of the set $G/G_{\mathcal{O}}$ (which is empty if $G_{\mathcal{O}} \neq G$).
9. **[major]** (Reference Validity) Theorem 5.5, Step 1, equation (25): The citation '[3, Prop. 2.46]' appears incorrect for the cited Annals version of HHR; in that version, 2.46 is a remark, not the stated double-coset formula for geometric fixed points of induction.
10. **[major]** (Reference Validity) Lemma 5.6 (first paragraph of proof): The claim that smashing with \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}\) is the relevant smashing Bousfield localization is attributed to '[4, §3.3]', but HPS is largely abstract and does not itself directly identify this specific equivariant localization in \(\mathrm{Sp}^G\).
11. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Transfer-systems paragraph before Lemma 5.2: The citation '[2, §3]' is too coarse for the specific subgroup-intersection closure used to define \(H_{\mathcal O}\). The argument relies on indexing-system closure properties (truncation + products + orbit decomposition), not just a single broad section reference.
