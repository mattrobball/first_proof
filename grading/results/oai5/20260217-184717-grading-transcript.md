## Solution Attempt

## 5 The \(\mathcal{O}\)-adapted slice filtration and a geometric fixed-point criterion for slice connectivity

### Problem

Fix a finite group \(G\). Let \(\mathcal{O}\) denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an \(N_\infty\) operad. Define the slice filtration on the \(G\)-equivariant stable category adapted to \(\mathcal{O}\) and state and prove a characterization of the \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity of a connective \(G\)-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

### Solution

**Conventions.** By a *localizing subcategory* of a stable category we mean a full subcategory closed under equivalences, cofibres (hence suspensions), extensions, and arbitrary coproducts (not necessarily under inverse suspension). For a collection of objects \(\mathcal{C}\) we write \(\operatorname{Loc}\langle\mathcal{C}\rangle\) for the smallest localizing subcategory containing \(\mathcal{C}\).

We write \(\Phi^H \colon \operatorname{Sp}^G \to \operatorname{Sp}\) for geometric \(H\)-fixed points. When we speak of the *connectivity* of \(\Phi^H(X)\) we mean the connectivity of the underlying nonequivariant spectrum. Let \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq k} \subset \operatorname{Sp}\) denote the usual full subcategory of \(k\)-connective spectra.

A \(G\)-spectrum \(X\) will be called *connective* if \(\Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq 0}\) for every \(H \leq G\).

**Lemma 5.1** (Connective spectra are generated by spheres). *For every integer \(c \geq 0\) one has*

\[
\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle = \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}.
\]

**Proof.** Since \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\) is closed under coproducts, cofibres, and extensions, and contains \(S^m\) for all \(m \geq c\), it contains \(\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\). Thus

\[
\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle \subseteq \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}.
\]

Conversely, let \(X \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\). By the standard cellular approximation theorem for spectra (see [1, \(\S\) III.2]) one can build a CW-approximation of \(X\) using only cells in degrees \(\geq c\): start with \(X_{-1} = 0\) and inductively construct a sequence

\[
X_{-1} \longrightarrow X_0 \longrightarrow X_1 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow X
\]

so that \(X_r \to X\) is \((c + r)\)-connective and \(X_r\) is obtained from \(X_{r-1}\) by attaching a wedge of spheres \(\bigvee \Sigma^m S^0\) with \(m \geq c + r\) (e.g. by killing the kernel of \(\pi_{c+r}(X_{r-1}) \to \pi_{c+r}(X)\) and then surjecting onto \(\pi_{c+r+1}(X)\)). Taking the sequential homotopy colimit (mapping telescope) yields an equivalence

\[
\operatorname*{hocolim}_r X_r \simeq X.
\]

Each \(X_r\) lies in \(\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\), and this subcategory is closed under sequential homotopy colimits because in a stable category \(\operatorname*{hocolim}_r X_r \simeq \operatorname{cofib}\bigl(\bigoplus_r X_r \xrightarrow{1-\text{shift}} \bigoplus_r X_r\bigr)\) is built from coproducts and a cofiber. Hence \(X \in \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\). \(\square\)

**Transfer systems from \(N_\infty\)-operads.** Write \(K \to H\) for the relation in the transfer system. For each \(H \leq G\) set

\[
\mathcal{O}_H := \{\, K \leq H \mid K \to H \,\}.
\]

If \(\mathcal{O}\) comes from an \(N_\infty\)-operad (equivalently an indexing system), then for each fixed \(H\) the family \(\mathcal{O}_H\) is closed under \(H\)-conjugation and finite intersections (this reflects closure of admissible \(H\)-sets under products and subobjects; see [2, \(\S\)3]).

Consequently, \(\mathcal{O}_H\) has a smallest subgroup:

\[
H_{\mathcal{O}} := \bigcap_{\substack{K \leq H \\ K \to H}} K. \tag{22}
\]

This subgroup is normal in \(H\) and still belongs to \(\mathcal{O}_H\).

Define the index and the real permutation representation

\[
d_H := [H : H_{\mathcal{O}}] \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}, \qquad \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} := \mathbb{R}[H/H_{\mathcal{O}}]
\]

(the real vector space on the \(H\)-set of cosets, with the induced \(H\)-action).

**Lemma 5.2** (Conjugation and restriction invariance). *Let \(\mathcal{O}\) be the transfer system under discussion (coming from an \(N_\infty\)-operad, so that the subgroups \(H_{\mathcal{O}}\) of (22) are defined).*

1. *(Conjugation invariance.) For any \(g \in G\) and \(L \leq G\), conjugation induces a bijection between subgroups of \(L\) which transfer to \(L\) and subgroups of \(g^{-1}Lg\) which transfer to \(g^{-1}Lg\). Consequently*

\[
(g^{-1}Lg)_{\mathcal{O}} = g^{-1}L_{\mathcal{O}}g,
\]

*and in particular \(d_{g^{-1}Lg} = d_L\).*

2. *(Restriction to subgroups.) Let \(H \leq G\) and let \(\mathcal{O}|_H\) denote the restricted transfer system on \(H\) (i.e. \(K \to_{\mathcal{O}|_H} L\) iff \(K \to_{\mathcal{O}} L\) for \(K \leq L \leq H\)). Then for every \(L \leq H\) one has*

\[
L_{\mathcal{O}|_H} = L_{\mathcal{O}} \qquad \text{and hence} \qquad d_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H} = d_L^{\mathcal{O}}.
\]

**Proof.** (1) If \(K \leq L\) and \(K \to L\), closure of the transfer relation under conjugation implies \(g^{-1}Kg \to g^{-1}Lg\). This gives a bijection between the indexing sets in the defining intersections, so

\[
(g^{-1}Lg)_{\mathcal{O}} = \bigcap_{\substack{K' \leq g^{-1}Lg \\ K' \to g^{-1}Lg}} K' = \bigcap_{\substack{K \leq L \\ K \to L}} g^{-1}Kg = g^{-1}\Bigl(\bigcap_{\substack{K \leq L \\ K \to L}} K\Bigr)g = g^{-1}L_{\mathcal{O}}g.
\]

Taking indices yields \(d_{g^{-1}Lg} = d_L\).

(2) By definition of restriction, the collection \(\{\, K \leq L \mid K \to_{\mathcal{O}|_H} L \,\}\) coincides with \(\{\, K \leq L \mid K \to_{\mathcal{O}} L \,\}\) whenever \(L \leq H\), so the defining intersections agree. \(\square\)

**Lemma 5.3** (Monotonicity and an orbit-count estimate). *For the above transfer system let \(K \leq H \leq G\).*

1. *One has \(K_{\mathcal{O}} \leq K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\) and hence \(d_K \geq [K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\).*

2. *The number of \(K\)-orbits in \(H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\) satisfies*

\[
\bigl|K \backslash H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| = \frac{|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}|}{|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}|} \geq \frac{d_H}{d_K}.
\]

**Proof.** (1) By the restriction axiom for transfer systems, from \(H_{\mathcal{O}} \to H\) we obtain \(K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}} \to K\). Since \(K_{\mathcal{O}}\) is the smallest subgroup in \(\mathcal{O}_K\) (by the same construction (22) applied to \(K\)), we have \(K_{\mathcal{O}} \leq K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\). Taking indices gives \(d_K = [K : K_{\mathcal{O}}] \geq [K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\).

(2) Because \(H_{\mathcal{O}} \unlhd H\), the stabilizer in \(K\) of any coset in \(H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\) is exactly \(K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\). Hence every \(K\)-orbit has cardinality \([K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\), so

\[
\bigl|K \backslash H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| = \frac{|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}|}{|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}|}.
\]

The inequality follows from (1): \(|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}| \leq d_K\) and \(|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}| = d_H\). \(\square\)

**The \(\mathcal{O}\)-adapted (regular) slice filtration.** For each integer \(n\) define \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subset \operatorname{Sp}^G\) to be the localizing subcategory generated by the \(\mathcal{O}\)*-slice cells*

\[
G_+ \wedge_H S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} \qquad (H \leq G,\; m \in \mathbb{Z},\; md_H \geq n). \tag{23}
\]

Here \(S^V\) denotes the representation sphere of a (virtual) real \(H\)-representation \(V\); for \(m < 0\) the notation means the corresponding desuspension by the virtual representation \(m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}\). The full subcategories \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) form a decreasing filtration of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\); in what follows we only use these subcategories themselves.

We will use the following (well-known) result.

**Lemma 5.4** (Geometric fixed points detect equivalences). *A map \(f \colon X \to Y\) in \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\) is an equivalence if and only if \(\Phi^H(f)\) is an equivalence of spectra for every subgroup \(H \leq G\).*

**Proof.** Only the "if" direction needs proof. Let \(F := \operatorname{fib}(f)\). Since each \(\Phi^H\) is exact, \(\Phi^H(F) \simeq \operatorname{fib}(\Phi^H(f)) \simeq 0\) for all \(H \leq G\). By [3, Prop. 2.52], this implies \(F \simeq 0\), hence \(f\) is an equivalence.

\(\square\)

**The fixed-point characterization of \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity.**

**Theorem 5.5.** *Let \(X\) be a connective \(G\)-spectrum and let \(n \geq 0\). Then*

\[
X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \iff \Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil} \text{ for every } H \leq G. \tag{24}
\]

**Proof.** Set

\[
\mathcal{P}_n(G) := \bigl\{\, Y \in \operatorname{Sp}^G \bigm| \Phi^H(Y) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil} \text{ for all } H \leq G \,\bigr\}.
\]

Because each \(\Phi^H\) is exact and preserves coproducts, and each \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq k}\) is localizing in \(\operatorname{Sp}\), the class \(\mathcal{P}_n(G)\) is a localizing subcategory of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\).

*Step 1:* \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq \mathcal{P}_n(G)\). Since \(\mathcal{P}_n(G)\) is localizing, it suffices to check the generators (23). Fix a generator

\[
Y = G_+ \wedge_H S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} \quad \text{with} \quad md_H \geq n.
\]

Because \(n \geq 0\) and \(d_H \geq 1\), this forces \(m \geq 0\).

Fix \(K \leq G\). A standard double-coset formula for geometric fixed points of induced spectra (see e.g. [3, Prop. 2.46]) gives an equivalence

\[
\Phi^K(G_+ \wedge_H Z) \;\simeq\; \bigvee_{\substack{[g] \in K \backslash G / H \\ K^g \leq H}} \Sigma^\infty(W_G K / W_H K^g)_+ \;\wedge\; \Phi^{K^g}(Z), \tag{25}
\]

natural in the \(H\)-spectrum \(Z\), where \(K^g := g^{-1}Kg\) and \(W_L M = N_L(M)/M\) denotes the Weyl group (the subgroup \(W_H K^g\) is viewed inside \(W_G K\) by conjugation with \(g\)). Applying this with \(Z = S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}\) and using that geometric fixed points of a representation sphere are the sphere of the fixed subrepresentation,

\[
\Phi^{K^g}(S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\simeq\; S^{m(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}},
\]

we obtain

\[
\Phi^K(Y) \;\simeq\; \bigvee_{\substack{[g] \in K \backslash G / H \\ K^g \leq H}} \Sigma^\infty(W_G K / W_H K^g)_+ \;\wedge\; S^{m(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}}.
\]

If the indexing set is empty then this wedge is the zero spectrum (and hence is connective in every degree), so there is nothing to prove. Otherwise smashing with \(\Sigma^\infty\) of a finite set merely produces a finite wedge of the same sphere, and it remains to understand the dimension of \((\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}\). Since \(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathbb{R}[H/H_{\mathcal{O}}]\) is a permutation representation, the fixed subspace has dimension equal to the number of orbits:

\[
\dim\bigl((\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}\bigr) = \bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr|.
\]

Because \(K^g \leq H\), Lemma 5.3(2) applied to \(K^g \leq H\) gives

\[
\bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| \;\geq\; \frac{d_H}{d_{K^g}}.
\]

By Lemma 5.2(1) we have \(d_{K^g} = d_K\), hence

\[
\bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| \;\geq\; \frac{d_H}{d_K}.
\]

Therefore every sphere summand has dimension at least \(m(d_H/d_K) \geq n/d_K\), hence at least \(\lceil n/d_K \rceil\) since it is integral. Thus \(\Phi^K(Y) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_K \rceil}\) for all \(K\), so \(Y \in \mathcal{P}_n(G)\), and \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq \mathcal{P}_n(G)\) follows.

*Step 2:* \(\mathcal{P}_n(G) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). We prove this by induction on \(|G|\). When \(G = e\), we have \(d_e = 1\) and

\[
\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} = \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq n \,\rangle = \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq n}
\]

by Lemma 5.1, so the claim is the ordinary Postnikov connectivity statement.

Assume now \(G \neq e\) and that the statement holds for all proper subgroups of \(G\) (with the restricted transfer system). Let \(X\) be connective and assume \(X \in \mathcal{P}_n(G)\), i.e. \(\Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil}\) for all \(H \leq G\).

Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of proper subgroups of \(G\) and consider isotropy separation:

\[
E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X. \tag{26}
\]

*Step 2a:* \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). For each proper \(H < G\), the restricted \(H\)-spectrum \(\operatorname{res}_H^G X\) is connective and satisfies the same geometric fixed-point bounds for all \(L \leq H\):

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G X) \simeq \Phi^L(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_L \rceil}.
\]

Here \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\) denotes the filtration for the restricted transfer system \(\mathcal{O}|_H\); by Lemma 5.2(2) the subgroups \(L_{\mathcal{O}|_H}\) (and hence the integers \(d_L\)) agree with those computed in \(G\) for all \(L \leq H\). Therefore the inductive hypothesis applies and gives

\[
\operatorname{res}_H^G X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H).
\]

A \(G\)-CW filtration of \(E\mathcal{F}\) has cells \(G/H \times D^r\) with \(H \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(r \geq 0\). Smashing with \(X\), the successive cofibres in the skeletal filtration are wedges of spectra

\[
G/H_+ \wedge S^r \wedge X \;\simeq\; G_+ \wedge_H \Sigma^r(\operatorname{res}_H^G X).
\]

Induction \(G_+ \wedge_H (-)\) is exact and preserves coproducts, hence sends localizing subcategories to localizing subcategories; moreover it sends each \(\mathcal{O}|_H\)-slice cell \(H_+ \wedge_L S^{m\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H}}\) (with \(L \leq H\)) to the corresponding \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice cell \(G_+ \wedge_L S^{m\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}}}\) (using Lemma 5.2(2) to identify \(\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H} = \rho_L^{\mathcal{O}}\)). Thus

\[
G_+ \wedge_H \bigl(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\bigr) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G).
\]

Since suspension preserves \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), each skeletal stage of \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X\) lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). Finally, \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) is closed under sequential homotopy colimits (mapping telescopes) because it is closed under coproducts and cofibres; hence the colimit \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X\) lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).

*Step 2b:* \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). Set \(Z := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X\). Then \(Z\) is concentrated over \(G\):

\[
\Phi^H(Z) \simeq 0 \quad (H < G), \qquad \Phi^G(Z) \simeq \Phi^G(X).
\]

Let \(c := \lceil n/d_G \rceil \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\). By assumption \(\Phi^G(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\), hence \(\Phi^G(Z) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\). By Lemma 5.1, this implies

\[
\Phi^G(Z) \;\in\; \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle. \tag{27}
\]

Consider the exact functor

\[
L \colon \operatorname{Sp} \to \operatorname{Sp}^G, \qquad L(W) := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W,
\]

where \(\epsilon^*\) denotes the trivial \(G\)-action. The spectrum \(L(W)\) is concentrated over \(G\) and satisfies \(\Phi^G(L(W)) \simeq W\).

**Lemma 5.6** (Spectra concentrated over \(G\)). *Let \(\mathcal{C} \subset \operatorname{Sp}^G\) be the full subcategory of \(G\)-spectra \(T\) such that \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge T \simeq 0\) (equivalently \(\Phi^H(T) \simeq 0\) for every proper subgroup \(H < G\)). Then*

\[
\Phi^G \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \operatorname{Sp}
\]

*is an equivalence and a quasi-inverse is \(L(W) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W\). In particular, for every \(Z \in \mathcal{C}\) there is a natural map*

\[
\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^*(\Phi^G Z) \longrightarrow Z
\]

*which is an equivalence.*

**Proof.** We shall use two standard pieces of equivariant stable homotopy theory. First, smashing with \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}\) is a smashing Bousfield localization of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\): its local objects are precisely the spectra \(T\) with \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge T \simeq 0\), and the functor \(L_{\mathcal{F}}(Y) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge Y\) is left adjoint to the inclusion of this full subcategory (for example [4, \(\S\)3.3]). Secondly, for a finite group the geometric fixed point functors are exact, preserve arbitrary homotopy colimits and are strong symmetric monoidal, and for a suspension spectrum one has \(\Phi^H(\Sigma^\infty A) \simeq \Sigma^\infty(A^H)\); we refer to [5, \(\S\)V.4] (see also [3, \(\S\)2]).

Let us first check that the two descriptions of \(\mathcal{C}\) agree. If \(T \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge T\), then for every proper \(H < G\) the preceding properties give \(\Phi^H(T) \simeq \Phi^H(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}) \wedge \Phi^H(T) \simeq 0\). Conversely, if all these proper geometric fixed points vanish, the map \(T \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge T\) in the isotropy-separation cofibre sequence is an equivalence after applying every \(\Phi^H\) (for \(H = G\) because \(\Phi^G(E\mathcal{F}_+) \simeq 0\)), and hence is an equivalence by Lemma 5.4. Thus \(\mathcal{C}\) is exactly the local subcategory for this smashing localization.

Put \(L(W) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W\). If \(X \in \mathcal{C}\), the localization adjunction and the ordinary adjunction \(\epsilon^* \dashv (-)^G_{\mathrm{cat}}\) for categorical fixed points give natural isomorphisms of morphism sets

\[
[\, L(W),\, X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}^G} \;\cong\; [\, \epsilon^* W,\, X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}^G} \;\cong\; [\, W,\, X^G_{\mathrm{cat}} \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}} \;=\; [\, W,\, \Phi^G X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}}, \tag{28}
\]

where in the last step we used \(X \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X\). Hence \(L \colon \operatorname{Sp} \to \mathcal{C}\) is left adjoint to the restricted functor \(\Phi^G\).

The unit of this adjunction is an isomorphism. Indeed the monoidality just recalled and the calculation of the geometric fixed points of the universal spaces give natural equivalences

\[
\Phi^G L(W) \;\simeq\; \Phi^G(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}) \wedge \Phi^G(\epsilon^* W) \;\simeq\; S^0 \wedge W \;\simeq\; W.
\]

For the second equivalence note that the exact coproduct-preserving functor \(\Phi^G \epsilon^*\) agrees with the identity on all suspension spheres, and hence on all spectra by the universal property of the stable homotopy category. Under these identifications the adjunction unit is the inverse equivalence: for \(W = S^0\) it is induced by the collapse map \(S^0 \to \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}\) (after applying \(\Phi^G\)), and since both functors are exact and preserve arbitrary coproducts while \(S^0\) is a compact generator of \(\operatorname{Sp}\), the unit is an isomorphism for every \(W\). By the triangular identity for the adjunction (28), the counit

\[
\epsilon_X \colon \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^*(\Phi^G X) \longrightarrow X, \qquad X \in \mathcal{C},
\]

therefore becomes an equivalence after applying \(\Phi^G\). For a proper subgroup both source and target have trivial geometric fixed points, so Lemma 5.4 shows that \(\epsilon_X\) itself is an equivalence. This counit is the displayed natural map and the two functors are quasi-inverse equivalences. \(\square\)

Applying \(L\) to (27) and using exactness and coproduct preservation, we obtain

\[
Z \simeq L(\Phi^G Z) \;\in\; \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}^G}\langle\, L(S^m) \mid m \geq c \,\rangle. \tag{29}
\]

Thus it suffices to show \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) for every \(m \geq c\).

**Claim 5.7.** *If \(m \geq 0\) and \(md_G \geq n\), then \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).*

**Proof.** The generator \(S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\) belongs to \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) by definition since \(md_G \geq n\).

We first show \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). For a proper subgroup \(H < G\), the restricted \(H\)-spectrum \(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\) is connective and, for \(L \leq H\),

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\simeq\; S^{m(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^L}.
\]

Since \(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathbb{R}[G/G_{\mathcal{O}}]\) is a permutation representation, \(\dim((\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^L) = |L \backslash G / G_{\mathcal{O}}|\), and Lemma 5.3(2) (with \(H = G\)) yields \(|L \backslash G / G_{\mathcal{O}}| \geq d_G / d_L\). Hence

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\in\; \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_L \rceil}.
\]

By the inductive hypothesis applied to the group \(H\) (with the restricted transfer system, and using Lemma 5.2(2) to identify the same \(d_L\)), we conclude \(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\) for all proper \(H < G\). The same \(G\)-CW cellular argument as in Step 2a (using exactness/coproduct preservation of induction and closure under sequential homotopy colimits) then shows \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).

Now in the cofiber sequence

\[
E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \longrightarrow S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}},
\]

the first two terms lie in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), so the third term does as well:

\[
\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}. \tag{30}
\]

Set \(Z_0 := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\). Then \(Z_0\) is concentrated over \(G\), so \(\Phi^H(Z_0) \simeq 0\) for every proper subgroup \(H < G\), while

\[
\Phi^G(Z_0) \simeq S^{m(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G} \simeq S^m,
\]

since \((\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G \cong \mathbb{R}\) (constant functions on \(G/G_{\mathcal{O}}\)). Therefore Lemma 5.6 (applied to \(Z_0 \in \mathcal{C}\)) supplies a natural equivalence

\[
L(S^m) = L(\Phi^G Z_0) \xrightarrow{\;\simeq\;} Z_0 = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}.
\]

Since the right-hand side lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) by (30), and \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) is closed under equivalences, it follows that \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). \(\square\)

Now if \(m \geq c = \lceil n/d_G \rceil\), then \(m \geq 0\) and \(md_G \geq n\), so Claim 5.7 applies. Therefore all generators in (29) lie in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), hence \(Z \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\).

*Step 2c: conclude.* In (26), both end terms lie in the localizing subcategory \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), which is closed under extensions, hence \(X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\).

Combining Steps 1 and 2 proves (24). \(\square\)

**Remark 5.8** (Two extremes). If \(\mathcal{O}\) allows all transfers, then \(H_{\mathcal{O}} = e\) and \(d_H = |H|\), and Theorem 5.5 recovers the usual regular slice-connectivity criterion. If \(\mathcal{O}\) only allows trivial transfers, then \(H_{\mathcal{O}} = H\) and \(d_H = 1\) for all \(H\), and the filtration \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) reduces to the ordinary Postnikov filtration.

## Editor Dispatch

## Editor Dispatch — Problem 5, Loop 1

This proof concerns advanced equivariant stable homotopy theory (slice filtrations, geometric fixed points, transfer systems from N∞ operads). The arguments are lengthy and technically dense, involving induction on group order, isotropy separation, double-coset formulas, and localizing subcategory arguments. Here is my assignment rationale:

**Correctness & Completeness** — This is the most demanding perspective for a proof of this complexity. The inductive structure (Step 2a/2b/2c), the double-coset formula application in Step 1, the orbit-counting estimates, and the equivalence of categories in Lemma 5.6 all require careful logical scrutiny. I assign **claude_code**, which has the strongest capacity for tracking extended chains of logical reasoning and catching subtle gaps in multi-step arguments.

**Clarity & Rigor** — The proof introduces substantial notation (H_O, d_H, ρ_H^O, the functor L, the family F) and must maintain consistency across lemmas and the main theorem. Checking notational precision, definition consistency, and whether the exposition meets graduate-level rigor standards is well-suited to **gemini_api**, which can effectively audit formal structure and presentation quality.

**Reference Validity** — Verifying that citations [1]–[5] are real, that the invoked results (cellular approximation, double-coset formula, geometric fixed points detecting equivalences, smashing localizations) are correctly attributed and have their hypotheses satisfied requires cross-referencing external mathematical literature. I assign **codex_cli**, which can systematically check each reference claim against known mathematical sources.

### Overall Assessment

This is a sophisticated and largely well-executed proof establishing the geometric fixed-point characterization of $\mathcal{O}$-slice connectivity for connective $G$-spectra. The proof architecture — isotropy separation combined with induction on group order — is standard and appropriate. The key innovations are the orbit-counting estimates (Lemma 5.3) linking the transfer system data to fixed-point dimensions, and the careful use of the equivalence $\mathcal{C} \simeq \operatorname{Sp}$ (Lemma 5.6) to handle the $G$-concentrated piece. I will flag issues in decreasing order of severity.

### Detailed Analysis

**Lemma 5.1.** The argument is correct. The CW-approximation procedure is standard, and the closure of localizing subcategories under sequential homotopy colimits (via the telescope = cofiber of shift on coproduct) is correctly invoked.

**Lemma 5.2.** Both parts are straightforward and correct. Part (1) uses conjugation-invariance of the transfer relation; part (2) is immediate from the definition of restriction.

**Lemma 5.3.** Part (1) is correct: the restriction axiom gives $K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}} \in \mathcal{O}_K$, so $K_{\mathcal{O}} \leq K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}$. Part (2) uses the claim that since $H_{\mathcal{O}} \unlhd H$, the $K$-stabilizer of any coset in $H/H_{\mathcal{O}}$ is $K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}$. This is correct: for $K \leq H$ and $N \unlhd H$, $K$ acts on $H/N$ by left multiplication, and the stabilizer of any coset $hN$ is $K \cap hNh^{-1} = K \cap N$ (since $N$ is normal). So all orbits have the same size $[K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]$, making the orbit count formula correct. However, the lemma states $|K \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}|$ (double cosets), while the proof computes the number of $K$-orbits on $H/H_{\mathcal{O}}$. These coincide when $H_{\mathcal{O}} \unlhd H$, since left cosets equal double cosets in that case. This is fine but could be noted.

**Theorem 5.5, Step 1.** The double-coset formula (25) is applied correctly. The key dimension estimate uses the orbit count from Lemma 5.3(2) and conjugation invariance from Lemma 5.2(1). However, there is an important issue in the integrality argument: the proof claims $m \cdot |K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}| \geq m \cdot d_H/d_K \geq n/d_K$, and then asserts this is $\geq \lceil n/d_K \rceil$ "since it is integral." The left side $m \cdot |K^g \backslash H/H_{\mathcal{O}}|$ is indeed an integer (product of integers), and it is $\geq n/d_K$ (a rational number). Any integer $\geq r$ is $\geq \lceil r \rceil$, so this step is correct.

**Theorem 5.5, Step 2a.** The inductive argument is well-structured. The key point is that $G_+ \wedge_H (-)$ sends $\mathcal{O}|_H$-slice cells to $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells. The proof asserts this using Lemma 5.2(2) to identify representations, which is correct. The cellular argument for $E\mathcal{F}_+$ is standard.

**Theorem 5.5, Step 2b and Lemma 5.6.** This is the most intricate part and deserves close scrutiny.

In Lemma 5.6, equation (28): the proof claims $X^G_{\mathrm{cat}} = \Phi^G X$ for $X \in \mathcal{C}$. This identification requires justification. For a general $G$-spectrum, categorical and geometric fixed points differ. The proof relies on $X \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X$, but the relationship between categorical and geometric fixed points for spectra concentrated over $G$ needs more than this. Specifically, geometric fixed points are computed as $\Phi^G(X) = (X \wedge \widetilde{E}\mathcal{P})^G_{\mathrm{cat}}$ where $\mathcal{P}$ is the family of proper subgroups. For $X \in \mathcal{C}$, we have $X \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X$, and $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}$ (both are the family of proper subgroups), so $\Phi^G(X) \simeq (\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X)^G_{\mathrm{cat}} \simeq X^G_{\mathrm{cat}}$. This is correct but the proof should be more explicit about this identification.

The unit/counit argument in Lemma 5.6 has a subtle point. The proof shows $\Phi^G \circ L \simeq \mathrm{id}$ (the unit is an isomorphism) and then uses the triangular identity to deduce that the counit is also an equivalence. This is a valid argument: if one of the unit/counit is an isomorphism in an adjunction between stable categories where the functors are exact, the other is as well, and the adjunction is an equivalence. However, the claim that $\Phi^G \epsilon^*$ "agrees with the identity on all suspension spheres, and hence on all spectra" deserves a brief note: $\Phi^G(\epsilon^* S^n) \simeq (S^{n\epsilon})^G \simeq S^n$ where $\epsilon$ denotes the trivial representation, and the extension to all spectra follows since $S^0$ is a compact generator and both functors are exact and coproduct-preserving.

**Claim 5.7.** The proof that $L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is clever: it identifies $L(S^m) \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}$ via Lemma 5.6 and shows both pieces of the isotropy separation lie in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. The computation $(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G \cong \mathbb{R}$ is correct since the $G$-fixed subspace of $\mathbb{R}[G/G_{\mathcal{O}}]$ is spanned by the sum of all cosets. The application of the inductive hypothesis to proper subgroups in the proof of $E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is correct but relies on the restricted spectrum being connective, which holds since $m \geq 0$ and all geometric fixed-point dimensions are non-negative.

**Step 2c.** The extension argument is correct: in the cofiber sequence (26), the fiber and cofiber both lie in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, so the middle term does too, since localizing subcategories are closed under extensions.

**Remark 5.8.** Both extreme cases are correctly described.

### Missing or Underspecified Points

1. The definition of "connective" uses geometric fixed points at all subgroups, which is a strong condition. This is stated but the relationship to other notions of connectivity could be clarified.

2. The proof of Theorem 5.5 only treats $n \geq 0$. For $n < 0$, every connective spectrum would need to lie in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, which should follow easily but is not addressed.

3. The double-coset formula (25) is stated with the condition $K^g \leq H$, but the standard formula involves all double cosets $[g] \in K \backslash G / H$, with the contribution from those with $K^g \not\leq H$ being zero (since $\Phi^{K^g}$ applied to an $H$-spectrum requires $K^g \leq H$ for a non-trivial contribution). This is implicit but could cause confusion.

## Reviewer — Clarity & Rigor

The proof provided is mathematically sound, rigorously argued, and well-structured. It correctly adapts standard techniques from equivariant stable homotopy theory (geometric fixed points, isotropy separation, properties of transfer systems) to the specific context of the $\mathcal{O}$-adapted slice filtration. The logic regarding the dimension of fixed points of permutation representations and the inductive step using the isotropy separation sequence is precise.

However, there are two minor points where clarity could be improved to meet the highest standards of exposition, particularly regarding terminology and specific linear algebra facts used in the proof.

## Grading Decision

The writeup is mathematically strong and close to complete, but not yet at full graduate-referee rigor. The core approach is correct and sophisticated, yet there are nontrivial completeness/justification issues in places where the proof depends on standard but unstated identifications, plus citation-precision problems for key invoked results. The largest blockers are: the Lemma 5.6 identification in (28), the localization claim/source in Lemma 5.6, the mismatched citation for the double-coset geometric fixed-point formula, and the unaddressed negative-\(n\) scope question.

These are significant rigor/completeness issues but appear readily repairable, so the attempt is near-complete rather than fully finished."
