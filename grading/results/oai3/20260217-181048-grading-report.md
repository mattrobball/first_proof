## Summary

The solution attempts to show the problem is ill-posed by arguing that the stationary weights can be negative for certain real specializations. It correctly computes explicit formulas for the minimal case λ=(2,0) using the q=1 factorization of interpolation ASEP polynomials and exhibits a specialization yielding a negative weight. However, the argument has significant logical gaps: it only refutes the universal-quantifier interpretation and does not analyze the natural parameter regime (0<t<1, x_i>0) standard in Macdonald polynomial theory. The dismissal of parametric Markov chains as meaningless over rational function fields reflects a conceptual misunderstanding of standard objects in algebraic combinatorics. The primary citation is fabricated (incorrect arXiv ID and co-authorship), though the underlying formulas appear to be mathematically real. The explicit computation is correct and offers a useful starting point, but the core question remains unresolved.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[critical]** (Correctness & Completeness) overall claim and final conclusion: The argument proves failure at one specialization, which only refutes a universal statement ('for all parameter values'). It does not fully resolve the original existential question for fixed admissible parameters/chambers.
2. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) counterexample specialization after equation (21): The choice x_1=0 is used without establishing it lies in the intended admissible parameter region. If strict positivity or other constraints are intended, this specific point could be excluded.
3. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Conclusion / final paragraph: The submission does not rule out the existence of a parameter regime where all weights are non-negative. The counterexample uses t=2, x_1=0, x_2=10, but does not check the regime 0<t<1 with positive x_i, which is natural in Macdonald polynomial theory.
4. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Interpretive argument, paragraph beginning 'This example shows two things': The dismissal of the formal-variable reading is too hasty. Parametric Markov chains with rational transition probabilities are standard objects in algebraic combinatorics; the problem may be asking for such a chain valid in an implicit natural domain.
5. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Equation (18)–(19), derivation from (15): The computation applying (15) to get individual f*_μ polynomials for the two compositions (2,0) and (0,2) is not shown in detail. The reader must reconstruct which support set S corresponds to which composition and verify the scalar prefactors.
6. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Equation (16), claim P*_{(2,0)} = (e*_1)^2: The conjugate partition λ' = (1,1) is stated without derivation, and the product formula gives two factors e*_{λ'_1} · e*_{λ'_2} = (e*_1)^2, which should be made explicit.
7. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Equations (15) and (17): The notation #(S^c ∩ {1,...,i-1}) is used without gloss. While standard, at graduate rigor level it should be defined on first use.
8. **[critical]** (Reference Validity) References [1] and Solution paragraph 2: The citation provided (arXiv:2510.02587) is invalid/hallucinated. The identifier implies a future date, and the authorship is incorrect. The paper 'A combinatorial formula for interpolation Macdonald polynomials' is authored by Houcine Ben Dali alone, not jointly with L. K. Williams.
9. **[major]** (Reference Validity) Equations (15), (16), (17): The specific formulas for the factorization at q=1 are attributed to the invalid reference. Without a valid source, these definitions are unjustified assertions.
