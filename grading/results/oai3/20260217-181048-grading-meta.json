It correctly computes explicit formulas for the minimal case \u03bb=(2,0) using the q=1 factorization of interpolation ASEP polynomials and exhibits a specialization yielding a negative weight. However, the argument has significant logical gaps: it only refutes the universal-quantifier interpretation and does not analyze the natural parameter regime (0<t<1, x_i>0) standard in Macdonald polynomial theory. The dismissal of parametric Markov chains as meaningless over rational function fields reflects a conceptual misunderstanding of standard objects in algebraic combinatorics. The primary citation is fabricated (incorrect arXiv ID and co-authorship), though the underlying formulas appear to be mathematically real. The explicit computation is correct and offers a useful starting point, but the core question remains unresolved."
