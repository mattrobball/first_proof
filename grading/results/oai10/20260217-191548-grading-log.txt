  [+03:11] Grade: 4/4
  [+03:11] Issues: 6 major, 11 minor
  [+03:11] Summary: The solution correctly derives a matrix-free PCG algorithm with a Kronecker-structured preconditioner, efficiently handling the sparse observations and RKHS constraints. The approach avoids O(N) computations as required. Reviewer critiques regarding the rigorous probabilistic justification of the preconditioner and the representer theorem are either minor expositional points or outside the scope of the specific prompt.
