  [+04:08] Summary: The solution successfully outlines a correct construction using a spin-lift of a hyperbolic lattice and rational surgery. The central insight of using an idempotent to manage the group ring algebra is effective. However, the proof contains non-trivial gaps in rigor, particularly regarding the explicit vanishing of the surgery obstruction in the orthogonal component and the verification of involution compatibility. There is also a technical error in the citation of stable homotopy groups. The result is correct, but the proof requires expert revision to be fully rigorous.
