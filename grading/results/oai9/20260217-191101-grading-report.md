## Summary

This is a nearly complete proof with a correct high-level strategy: define F by rank-4 flattening constraints, show multiplicative scaling implies vanishing minors, and conversely recover four-mode factorization from rank bounds and genericity. The principal remaining gap is the complex-to-real genericity transfer in Step 2, which needs explicit real-algebraic justification; the rest are minor rigor/clarity improvements (constant-triple edge-case statements, explicit invertibility reminders, symmetric mode arguments, notation cleanup, and clearer phase-sign bookkeeping).

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 5, equation (86) and surrounding argument: The proof does not explicitly address what happens to columns of Flat_1(T) coming from constant triples (β,β,β). While the conclusion that these columns must lie in D_{bcd}W follows logically from the rank bound, it would strengthen the argument to verify this independently or at least note that it is a consequence rather than something assumed.
2. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 6, treatment of constant triples after equation (92): The proof establishes λ_{αβββ} = u_α v_β w_β x_β for α ≠ β but does not explicitly note that the all-identical case (α = β) is excluded from the required factorization domain. While this follows from condition (84) and the problem statement, it should be stated explicitly for completeness.
3. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 5, application of Lemma 9.2: The proof applies Lemma 9.2 to H_{βγδ} = D_{bcd}^{-1} D_{βγδ}, claiming this has the form diag(h_α I_3). This is true: D_{bcd} = diag(λ_{α,b,c,d} I_3) and D_{βγδ} = diag(λ_{α,β,γ,δ} I_3), so H_{βγδ} = diag((λ_{α,β,γ,δ}/λ_{α,b,c,d}) I_3). However, the proof should note that D_{bcd} is invertible (which requires λ_{α,b,c,d} ≠ 0 for all α, guaranteed by (84) since (b,c,d) is not constant and hence (α,b,c,d) is not all identical for any α).
4. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 2, genericity condition (G3): The proof verifies (G3) for the cases where two hyperplanes coincide and where all three are distinct, but does not explicitly note that permuting the roles covers all non-constant triples. A non-constant triple could have exactly two equal indices in different positions (e.g., (β,γ,β) with β≠γ), and the argument should clarify that permuting the positions in the earlier verification handles these.
5. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 7, phase cancellation: The proof claims θ + φ + ψ + χ ≡ 0 (mod π) from the fact that u_p v_p w_q x_r is real. But the individual ratios like u_α/u_p being real means u_α = u_p · (real number), so u_α = |u_α| e^{iθ} · (±1). This means u_α has phase θ or θ+π. The product u_p v_p w_q x_r involves phases θ + φ + (ψ or ψ+π) + (χ or χ+π), so we get θ+φ+ψ+χ ≡ 0 (mod π). This is correct but the writeup could be clearer about the sign ambiguities.
6. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 2 (final paragraph: complex-open to real-generic transfer): The move from a nonempty Zariski-open subset over C to 'Zariski-generic real cameras satisfy (G1)-(G3)' is asserted but not explicitly justified, even though the theorem is over R.
7. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 0, Lemma 9.1, Step 4/7 (symbol x): The symbol x is reused for different objects (ambient coordinates, a test row vector, and the 4th scaling factor), which makes key formulas harder to parse precisely.
8. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 5 (derivation of (88) and (89)): Mode-2 and mode-3 factorizations are deferred to symmetry without explicitly stating the analogous subspace identity and invertibility argument.
9. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 7 (phase normalization): The phase argument is correct but compressed where sign contributions are folded into 'mod pi', which is slightly terse for graduate-level rigor.
