  [+04:28] --- Grading Report: oai9 ---
  [+04:28] Grade: 3/4
  [+04:28] Issues: 1 major, 8 minor
  [+04:28] Summary: This is a nearly complete proof with a correct high-level strategy: define F by rank-4 flattening constraints, show multiplicative scaling implies vanishing minors, and conversely recover four-mode factorization from rank bounds and genericity. The principal remaining gap is the complex-to-real genericity transfer in Step 2, which needs explicit real-algebraic justification; the rest are minor rigor/clarity improvements (constant-triple edge-case statements, explicit invertibility reminders, symmetric mode arguments, notation cleanup, and clearer phase-sign bookkeeping).
