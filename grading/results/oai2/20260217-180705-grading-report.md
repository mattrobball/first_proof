## Summary

The solution presents a well-conceived and nearly complete proof that a universal Whittaker function W exists making the twisted Rankin–Selberg integral finite and nonzero for all s. The strategy—prescribing W on the mirabolic via the compact Kirillov model, reducing to a compact integral independent of s, and establishing nonvanishing via Howe vectors—is mathematically sound and demonstrates expert-level understanding. The main gap is the untranslated passage from Baruch's Howe vector computations to the specific block-form description in Proposition 2.3, which is the central nonvanishing input. While this translation is almost certainly correct, it requires a page or so of explicit coordinate computation that the text omits. Secondary gaps include missing matrix-entry verifications and compressed projection-formula derivations. All gaps are of a routine character that an expert could fill in a short sitting. No logical errors, hallucinated results, or conceptual misunderstandings were identified.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[critical]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.4, Proposition 2.3: The translation from Baruch's Whittaker value computations on the big Bruhat cell to the compact quotient H\K_n in the block form (11)–(12) is asserted but not carried out. This is the central technical claim and cannot be verified from the text as written.
2. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.5, equation (13): The identification k_{nn} = r_{n-1} (where r_{n-1} comes from the block form of kw) is used without justification. Since w swaps the last two columns, the relationship between entries of k and entries of kw needs explicit verification.
3. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.4, block decomposition (11): The proof does not verify that left multiplication by H can always put kw in the form (11) when k_{n,n-1} is a unit, nor that the H-element used is uniquely determined (or that the ambiguity does not affect the argument).
4. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.4, projection formula (10): The change of variables k → ku(x) in the integral over H\K_n is asserted to yield the factored inner integrals, but the computation of (ku(x))_{ni} and the compatibility with the H\K_n quotient measure are not verified.
5. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.6, case n=1: The n=1 case verifies nonvanishing of the Gauss sum but does not explicitly connect back to the universal W constructed in Steps 1–2. It should verify that the compact integral (7) specializes to the Gauss sum for the particular f from Lemma 2.1 when n=1.
6. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.3–2.4: The proof switches between ψ^{-1}(Qk_{nn}) in (7) and ψ(-Qk_{nn}) in (8) without noting the convention ψ^{-1}(·) = ψ(-·).
7. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) §2.6, unramified case: The unramified case claims Q is a unit when c(π) = 0, since q = o and q^{-1} = o. This is correct but the proof should note that W^∘(k) = 1 for all k ∈ K_n requires Λ(v^∘) = W^∘(1) = 1 AND K_n-invariance, which together give W^∘(k) = Λ(π(k)v^∘) = Λ(v^∘) = 1. The stated chain 'W^∘(k) = Λ(π(k)v^∘) = Λ(v^∘) = 1' is correct but uses the Whittaker functional Λ without introducing it.
8. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Proposition 2.3 (§2.4): This proposition is the key nonvanishing input in the ramified case, but it is presented as a custom statement with broad citations and no precise theorem numbering or full hypothesis matching. The translation from Baruch/Howe-vector notation to conditions (11)–(12) is asserted rather than demonstrated.
9. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Equations (10) and (13) (§2.4–§2.5): The projection formula and subsequent identification of the integration domain with C_m are compressed. The derivation uses a nontrivial change of variables on H\\K_n plus additive-character orthogonality, and sign/congruence bookkeeping is not fully spelled out.
10. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) §2.3–§2.5 notation: The symbol W is reused for Whittaker functions on both G_{n+1} (fixed test vector) and G_n (generic variable in projections), which creates avoidable ambiguity.
11. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Lemma 2.1 proof (§2.2): Compact support modulo N_{n+1} is justified informally (“x-variable is irrelevant”) without an explicit quotient/orbit argument.
12. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) References / external inputs: Several citations are section-level only, which reduces traceability for verification at graduate rigor.
13. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Reference [4]: The reference is cited as an arXiv preprint from 2013, but it has since been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
14. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Proposition 2.3 / Reference [1]: The text asserts that Baruch [1, §7] proves the restriction is 'exactly the characteristic described in (12)'. Equation (12) defines the support relative to a specific permutation matrix $w$ (swapping the last two columns). Standard Howe vectors (as treated in Baruch) are typically supported near the identity $I_n$. While the result follows by translation, claiming Baruch derives this *exact* formula with this specific $w$ is likely imprecise.
