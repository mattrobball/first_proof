  [+03:42] Summary: The solution presents a well-conceived and nearly complete proof that a universal Whittaker function W exists making the twisted Rankin–Selberg integral finite and nonzero for all s. The strategy—prescribing W on the mirabolic via the compact Kirillov model, reducing to a compact integral independent of s, and establishing nonvanishing via Howe vectors—is mathematically sound and demonstrates expert-level understanding. The main gap is the untranslated passage from Baruch's Howe vector computations to the specific block-form description in Proposition 2.3, which is the central nonvanishing input. While this translation is almost certainly correct, it requires a page or so of explicit coordinate computation that the text omits. Secondary gaps include missing matrix-entry verifications and compressed projection-formula derivations. All gaps are of a routine character that an expert could fill in a short sitting. No logical errors, hallucinated results, or conceptual misunderstandings were identified.
