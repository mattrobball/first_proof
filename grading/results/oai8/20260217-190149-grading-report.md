## Summary

The solution provides a detailed constructive strategy using zero-action local smoothing models. It correctly identifies the symplectic constraints but lacks rigor in the global gluing arguments, specifically regarding the consistency of the smooth structure, global embeddedness, and the patching of local primitives.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 5 ("Topological isotopy to K at t=0", construction of Σ and f_t): The existence of a single global smooth parameter surface Σ and a globally smooth family f_t is asserted via collar gluing and reparametrizations Θ_{t,e}, but compatibility/cocycle checks are not fully proved. In particular, it is not shown rigorously that all overlap maps (for all incident edges at each vertex) define a consistent smooth structure and embeddings for every t.
2. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 6 (gluing local primitives into global S_t): The claim that local differences S_{t,*} agree on overlaps because they vanish on a stationary axial open subset is not proved for every connected overlap component. If an overlap component misses that subset, constants may not vanish, and the flux-cancellation argument is incomplete.
3. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 4 (edge normal form setup): The edge model assumes every treated edge is a genuine wedge of two distinct Lagrangian planes (so ω(b,a)≠0), but only inessential vertices are explicitly removed earlier; inessential coplanar edges are not separately reduced.
4. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Step 5/6 (scope: compact vs properly embedded noncompact): The writeup occasionally claims a noncompact properly embedded extension, but the isotopy-extension and support arguments are presented in a compact-style form.
5. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 6, application of Lemma 8.4: No analysis of the behavior of the Hamiltonian H(t, ·) as t → 0+. The shrinking support and potentially growing derivatives of cutoff functions may prevent smooth or even continuous extension to t = 0.
6. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 5, global embeddedness: Individual embeddedness of local patches and compatibility on overlaps does not immediately imply global embeddedness. Distinct patches with disjoint parameter domains could have intersecting images in R^4.
7. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Steps 3–5, neighborhood choices: Multiple shrinking arguments are invoked without tracking mutual dependencies. The reader cannot verify that a single consistent choice of ε₀ and neighborhoods exists satisfying all stated constraints simultaneously.
8. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Lemma 8.4, proof, tubular neighborhood construction: The claim that tubular neighborhoods, projections, and bump functions can be chosen with smooth dependence on t ∈ (0,1] is asserted but not adequately justified. The patching argument over the countable cover {[1/(k+1), 1/k]} is sketched too briefly for a result that the entire Hamiltonian construction depends on.
9. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 4, embeddedness of edge strip: The injectivity argument for Ψ_{ε,e} only handles the case of equal s-coordinates explicitly. For distinct s-values, it is claimed the points are 'obviously distinct,' but the first coordinate alone does not separate them since the third coordinate p_x depends on both s and r.
10. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 0 and throughout: The symbol ε is heavily overloaded: smoothing parameter ε(t), edge sign ε_e, sign function ε(P, P'; a, b), and the fixed scale ε₀. This creates unnecessary ambiguity in a proof where signs are critical.
11. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 2, after equation (60): The claim that the rescaled curve γ_ε has zero action is stated without computation. While straightforward, the rescaling integral should be verified since the zero-action property is essential for the exactness argument.
12. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Step 5, isotopy extension: The Edwards–Kirby isotopy extension theorem is for topological locally flat embeddings, but the hypotheses (local flatness at t = 0) are not verified. Since K is a polyhedral surface, local flatness of K₀ = K is not immediate and should be argued.
13. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Conclusion, final paragraph: The topological remark about χ(K) = 0 for compact orientable K is presented without noting that the problem statement does not assume compactness or orientability. This could mislead the reader into thinking these are standing hypotheses.
14. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 1, equation (55): The dual basis convention ω(f^j, e_i) = δ^j_i is asymmetric and could confuse readers who expect ω(e_i, f^j) = δ_{ij}. The subsequent computation ω(e_2, f^2) = -1 is correct but jarring without explicit comment.
15. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Step 5 (Topological isotopy) and Step 6 (Hamiltonian criterion): The text appeals to the 'standard isotopy-extension theorem' and 'standard exactness/flux criterion' without explicitly linking these claims to the provided bibliography entries (e.g., [4] and [2] respectively).
