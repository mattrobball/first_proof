  [+07:43] Grade: 3/4
  [+07:43] Issues: 6 major, 9 minor
  [+07:43] Summary: The solution provides a detailed constructive strategy using zero-action local smoothing models. It correctly identifies the symplectic constraints but lacks rigor in the global gluing arguments, specifically regarding the consistency of the smooth structure, global embeddedness, and the patching of local primitives.
