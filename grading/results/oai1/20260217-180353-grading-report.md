## Summary

The solution correctly identifies that the Phi^4_3 measure is mutually singular with its smooth shifts (for nonzero coupling) and equivalent in the free case. The proof strategy — constructing a log-normalised cubic observable that converges to zero under mu but diverges under the shifted measure due to the deterministic logarithmic mass renormalisation — is creative and essentially sound. The main gaps are: (1) the non-vanishing of the setting-sun coefficient b_lambda is asserted without proof or precise citation, (2) Proposition 1.1 is presented as a repackaging of literature results without sufficiently specific references or a self-contained derivation, and (3) the subsequence/Borel-Cantelli diagonal extraction is described informally rather than constructed explicitly. These are genuine rigor deficiencies at the graduate level, but all are fillable by an expert in short order, placing the attempt at nearly complete.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 2.2 / throughout: The claim that b_lambda != 0 for lambda != 0 is asserted without proof or precise citation. This is the linchpin of the entire argument — if b_lambda could vanish, the deterministic divergent term in (4) would vanish and the proof would fail.
2. **[major]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 2.5, second bullet (tightness of renormalized square term): The Borel–Cantelli extraction of an a.s. convergent subsequence for the second and third terms in (4) requires quantitative probability tail bounds (summable), not merely tightness. The proof only asserts 'tightness' and 'convergence to 0 in probability' before claiming a.s. convergence along a subsequence.
3. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 2.3, Proposition 1.1(i): The relationship between Theta_n and the pure setting-sun diagram tilde{Theta}_epsilon is described vaguely as differing by 'a uniformly L^2-bounded linear combination of more regular diagrams.' The specific diagrams are not named, and no explicit regularity exponents are given for them.
4. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 2.3, equation (1): In the definition of Y_n(w), the term 9b_lambda e^n w appears with the full distributional field w rather than the mollified field w_n. While the proof later explains this replacement is harmless, presenting it this way in the definition without comment is initially confusing, since the expression '9b_lambda e^n w' paired with psi involves a distributional pairing of w against psi, which is well-defined (psi is smooth) but looks inconsistent with the other terms involving w_n.
5. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Theorem 1.3 statement: The theorem states the result for 'a well-defined Phi_3^4 measure' but the proof only applies to measures realized as time-marginals of stationary solutions to stochastic quantization. Since uniqueness of the Phi_3^4 measure is not fully established, this is a (small) over-claim.
6. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 2.5, Wick square versus leading-order subtraction: The proof uses u_n^2 - a e^{e^n} and appeals to tightness results for the Wick square :u_epsilon^2: = u_epsilon^2 - C_1(epsilon). Since a e^{e^n} = C_1(epsilon_n) - O(1), the difference is O(1) * u_n tested against psi_n * psi, which is bounded. This is correct but unstated.
7. **[critical]** (Clarity & Rigor) Proposition 1.1 (statement and proof): This proposition is the linchpin of the singularity argument, but it is presented as a 'repackaging' of broad literature sections without theorem/lemma identifiers that explicitly yield exactly (i) and (ii) with the same objects and topology. The object Theta_n is not defined concretely enough to verify the claim.
8. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 2.2 and equations (1), (3), (4): Normalization consistency is not fully rigorous: constants a, b_lambda, and the factor 9 are asserted from convention, and non-vanishing of b_lambda is not tied to an explicit formula in the chosen convention. A mismatch here would break the deterministic diverging term used for separation.
9. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 2.5, bullets on the 2nd and 3rd terms in (4): Key tightness/convergence claims for the cross terms are asserted as 'standard output' without explicit quantitative bounds or precise citations. These are needed to justify the probabilistic limit and the later almost-sure subsequence extraction.
10. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Sections 2.4-2.5 (subsequence refinement, sets A and E): The diagonal/Borel-Cantelli refinement is described informally. At this rigor target, the exact construction of one subsequence that handles all required random terms simultaneously should be explicit.
11. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Gaussian case setup and theorem framing: The ambient state space switches between full D'(T^3) and pinned mean-zero subspace, but this is not fixed globally at the start. This can obscure which shift maps are admissible in each regime.
12. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) References: Reference [8] is cited as a preprint (2016), but it has since been published.
13. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Proof of Proposition 1.1, part (a): The citation '[8, Sec. 3]' for the covariance bound of the setting-sun diagram is somewhat broad.
