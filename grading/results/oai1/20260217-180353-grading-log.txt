  [+03:11] Summary: The solution correctly identifies that the Phi^4_3 measure is mutually singular with its smooth shifts (for nonzero coupling) and equivalent in the free case. The proof strategy — constructing a log-normalised cubic observable that converges to zero under mu but diverges under the shifted measure due to the deterministic logarithmic mass renormalisation — is creative and essentially sound. The main gaps are: (1) the non-vanishing of the setting-sun coefficient b_lambda is asserted without proof or precise citation, (2) Proposition 1.1 is presented as a repackaging of literature results without sufficiently specific references or a self-contained derivation, and (3) the subsequence/Borel-Cantelli diagonal extraction is described informally rather than constructed explicitly. These are genuine rigor deficiencies at the graduate level, but all are fillable by an expert in short order, placing the attempt at nearly complete.
