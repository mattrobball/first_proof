While the proof later explains this replacement is harmless, presenting it this way in the definition without comment is initially confusing, since the expression '9b_lambda e^n w' paired with psi involves a distributional pairing of w against psi, which is well-defined (psi is smooth) but looks inconsistent with the other terms involving w_n.",

This is inherent to the subject but worth noting.",

The proof strategy \u2014 constructing a log-normalised cubic observable that converges to zero under mu but diverges under the shifted measure due to the deterministic logarithmic mass renormalisation \u2014 is creative and essentially sound. The main gaps are: (1) the non-vanishing of the setting-sun coefficient b_lambda is asserted without proof or precise citation, (2) Proposition 1.1 is presented as a repackaging of literature results without sufficiently specific references or a self-contained derivation, and (3) the subsequence/Borel-Cantelli diagonal extraction is described informally rather than constructed explicitly. These are genuine rigor deficiencies at the graduate level, but all are fillable by an expert in short order, placing the attempt at nearly complete."
