## Summary

The solution correctly derives the inequality using a sophisticated transport argument for critical values via a doubly stochastic matrix. While the conceptual approach and final result are correct, the proof sketches several key algebraic verifications and limiting arguments (for multiple roots and interlacing) that require formal expansion to be fully rigorous.

## Reviewer Issues

1. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 1, eq (2.6): The proof of the decomposition identity R_{p⊞q} = (R_p ⊞_n q) + (p ⊞_n R_q) is described as a 'sketch' with only a brief parenthetical coefficient comparison, yet this identity is a load-bearing step used in the transport computation (Lemma 4.2) and the key decomposition (Section 6). The claimed splitting of k/n into i/n + j/n contributions is correct but not self-evident without a few lines of algebra.
2. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Lemma 4.1, positivity of w_i(p): The argument for positivity relies on an informal case split ('at a maximum one has p(ν_i) > 0 and p''(ν_i) < 0'). While correct, the local extremum characterization could be replaced by the direct identity p''(ν_i)/p(ν_i) = -∑_k (ν_i - λ_k)^{-2} < 0, which simultaneously proves strict sign opposition and that ν_i is a simple zero of p' — facts needed later.
3. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Lemma 4.3, non-negativity paragraph: The phrase 'move the common zeros by arbitrarily small alternating perturbations' is imprecise. The required perturbation is position-dependent: zeros ν_k with k < j are shifted rightward and those with k > j are shifted leftward, to place them in the correct inter-root intervals for strict interlacing with r_p. This is not 'alternating' in the usual sense.
4. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Theorem 4.4, interlacing preservation (degenerate case): When the leading coefficient of ap_1 + bp_2 vanishes (a + b = 0), the proof approximates by ap_1 + (b+ε)p_2 and 'passes to the limit.' The passage to the limit relies on the topological fact that real-rootedness is a closed condition in coefficient space, which is not stated.
5. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 5, induction on real-rootedness: The proof states that the induction proves 'simple inputs give simple outputs' but does not explicitly note that the inputs r_p and r_q to the degree-(n-1) convolution have simple zeros. This follows from the classical fact that if p has all real simple roots, then p' has all real simple roots (by Rolle's theorem + degree count), which is external to the induction.
6. **[minor]** (Correctness & Completeness) Section 8, limiting argument: The proof uses liminf to pass to the limit, but the function 1/Φ_n (with convention 1/∞ = 0) is in fact continuous on the entire space of monic real-rooted polynomials, making the liminf unnecessary. More importantly, the proof does not explicitly justify why Φ_n → ∞ when roots coalesce (equivalently, why 1/Φ_n → 0). This follows from the residue formula: a coalescing pair at distance δ contributes a weight w_i ~ Cδ² → 0, so 1/w_i → ∞.
7. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Lemma 4.3 (nonnegativity part): The reduction from padded degree-(m-1) inputs (e.g. \(\ell_j\)) to the strict interlacing theorem via \(\varepsilon\)-perturbations is described informally; the proof does not explicitly establish that the sign relation at \(\mu_i\) survives the two limiting steps.
8. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 4 to Theorem 4.4 dependency chain: Logical dependencies are hard to verify: Lemma 4.3 invokes the interlacing theorem proved later, while Theorem 4.4 uses nonnegativity from Lemma 4.3 in lower degree. This is likely salvageable, but not presented as a formally closed induction package.
9. **[major]** (Clarity & Rigor) Theorem 4.4 (interlacing-preservation proof, Obreschkoff step): The argument applies Obreschkoff in a 'limiting form' for cases with common zeros and possible degree drop, but the needed generalized statement is not explicitly given or proved.
10. **[minor]** (Clarity & Rigor) Section 8 (multiple-root limit passage): The claim that \(\Phi_n\to\infty\) as roots coalesce is correct but only sketched via (2.8), where the representation itself depends on simple-root setup.
11. **[minor]** (Reference Validity) Section 5, Theorem 4.4 proof: The citation 'Obreschkoff (Hermite--Kakeya--Obreschkoff) theorem' uses a non-standard compound name. While the statement of the theorem is correct (relating interlacing to the real-rootedness of linear combinations), this specific naming convention is rare and may obscure the standard reference for readers.
