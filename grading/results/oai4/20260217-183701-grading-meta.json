The required perturbation is position-dependent: zeros \u03bd_k with k < j are shifted rightward and those with k > j are shifted leftward, to place them in the correct inter-root intervals for strict interlacing with r_p.

More importantly, the proof does not explicitly justify why \u03a6_n \u2192 \u221e when roots coalesce (equivalently, why 1/\u03a6_n \u2192 0). This follows from the residue formula: a coalescing pair at distance \u03b4 contributes a weight w_i ~ C\u03b4\u00b2 \u2192 0, so 1/w_i \u2192 \u221e.",
