  [+09:58] Grade: 3/4
  [+09:58] Issues: 3 major, 8 minor
  [+09:58] Summary: The solution correctly derives the inequality using a sophisticated transport argument for critical values via a doubly stochastic matrix. While the conceptual approach and final result are correct, the proof sketches several key algebraic verifications and limiting arguments (for multiple roots and interlacing) that require formal expansion to be fully rigorous.
