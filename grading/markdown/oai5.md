## 5 The \(\mathcal{O}\)-adapted slice filtration and a geometric fixed-point criterion for slice connectivity

### Problem

Fix a finite group \(G\). Let \(\mathcal{O}\) denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an \(N_\infty\) operad. Define the slice filtration on the \(G\)-equivariant stable category adapted to \(\mathcal{O}\) and state and prove a characterization of the \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity of a connective \(G\)-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

### Solution

**Conventions.** By a *localizing subcategory* of a stable category we mean a full subcategory closed under equivalences, cofibres (hence suspensions), extensions, and arbitrary coproducts (not necessarily under inverse suspension). For a collection of objects \(\mathcal{C}\) we write \(\operatorname{Loc}\langle\mathcal{C}\rangle\) for the smallest localizing subcategory containing \(\mathcal{C}\).

We write \(\Phi^H \colon \operatorname{Sp}^G \to \operatorname{Sp}\) for geometric \(H\)-fixed points. When we speak of the *connectivity* of \(\Phi^H(X)\) we mean the connectivity of the underlying nonequivariant spectrum. Let \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq k} \subset \operatorname{Sp}\) denote the usual full subcategory of \(k\)-connective spectra.

A \(G\)-spectrum \(X\) will be called *connective* if \(\Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq 0}\) for every \(H \leq G\).

**Lemma 5.1** (Connective spectra are generated by spheres). *For every integer \(c \geq 0\) one has*

\[
\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle = \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}.
\]

**Proof.** Since \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\) is closed under coproducts, cofibres, and extensions, and contains \(S^m\) for all \(m \geq c\), it contains \(\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\). Thus

\[
\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle \subseteq \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}.
\]

Conversely, let \(X \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\). By the standard cellular approximation theorem for spectra (see [1, \(\S\) III.2]) one can build a CW-approximation of \(X\) using only cells in degrees \(\geq c\): start with \(X_{-1} = 0\) and inductively construct a sequence

\[
X_{-1} \longrightarrow X_0 \longrightarrow X_1 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow X
\]

so that \(X_r \to X\) is \((c + r)\)-connective and \(X_r\) is obtained from \(X_{r-1}\) by attaching a wedge of spheres \(\bigvee \Sigma^m S^0\) with \(m \geq c + r\) (e.g. by killing the kernel of \(\pi_{c+r}(X_{r-1}) \to \pi_{c+r}(X)\) and then surjecting onto \(\pi_{c+r+1}(X)\)). Taking the sequential homotopy colimit (mapping telescope) yields an equivalence

\[
\operatorname*{hocolim}_r X_r \simeq X.
\]

Each \(X_r\) lies in \(\operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\), and this subcategory is closed under sequential homotopy colimits because in a stable category \(\operatorname*{hocolim}_r X_r \simeq \operatorname{cofib}\bigl(\bigoplus_r X_r \xrightarrow{1-\text{shift}} \bigoplus_r X_r\bigr)\) is built from coproducts and a cofiber. Hence \(X \in \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle\). \(\square\)

**Transfer systems from \(N_\infty\)-operads.** Write \(K \to H\) for the relation in the transfer system. For each \(H \leq G\) set

\[
\mathcal{O}_H := \{\, K \leq H \mid K \to H \,\}.
\]

If \(\mathcal{O}\) comes from an \(N_\infty\)-operad (equivalently an indexing system), then for each fixed \(H\) the family \(\mathcal{O}_H\) is closed under \(H\)-conjugation and finite intersections (this reflects closure of admissible \(H\)-sets under products and subobjects; see [2, \(\S\)3]).

Consequently, \(\mathcal{O}_H\) has a smallest subgroup:

\[
H_{\mathcal{O}} := \bigcap_{\substack{K \leq H \\ K \to H}} K. \tag{22}
\]

This subgroup is normal in \(H\) and still belongs to \(\mathcal{O}_H\).

Define the index and the real permutation representation

\[
d_H := [H : H_{\mathcal{O}}] \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}, \qquad \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} := \mathbb{R}[H/H_{\mathcal{O}}]
\]

(the real vector space on the \(H\)-set of cosets, with the induced \(H\)-action).

**Lemma 5.2** (Conjugation and restriction invariance). *Let \(\mathcal{O}\) be the transfer system under discussion (coming from an \(N_\infty\)-operad, so that the subgroups \(H_{\mathcal{O}}\) of (22) are defined).*

1. *(Conjugation invariance.) For any \(g \in G\) and \(L \leq G\), conjugation induces a bijection between subgroups of \(L\) which transfer to \(L\) and subgroups of \(g^{-1}Lg\) which transfer to \(g^{-1}Lg\). Consequently*

\[
(g^{-1}Lg)_{\mathcal{O}} = g^{-1}L_{\mathcal{O}}g,
\]

*and in particular \(d_{g^{-1}Lg} = d_L\).*

2. *(Restriction to subgroups.) Let \(H \leq G\) and let \(\mathcal{O}|_H\) denote the restricted transfer system on \(H\) (i.e. \(K \to_{\mathcal{O}|_H} L\) iff \(K \to_{\mathcal{O}} L\) for \(K \leq L \leq H\)). Then for every \(L \leq H\) one has*

\[
L_{\mathcal{O}|_H} = L_{\mathcal{O}} \qquad \text{and hence} \qquad d_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H} = d_L^{\mathcal{O}}.
\]

**Proof.** (1) If \(K \leq L\) and \(K \to L\), closure of the transfer relation under conjugation implies \(g^{-1}Kg \to g^{-1}Lg\). This gives a bijection between the indexing sets in the defining intersections, so

\[
(g^{-1}Lg)_{\mathcal{O}} = \bigcap_{\substack{K' \leq g^{-1}Lg \\ K' \to g^{-1}Lg}} K' = \bigcap_{\substack{K \leq L \\ K \to L}} g^{-1}Kg = g^{-1}\Bigl(\bigcap_{\substack{K \leq L \\ K \to L}} K\Bigr)g = g^{-1}L_{\mathcal{O}}g.
\]

Taking indices yields \(d_{g^{-1}Lg} = d_L\).

(2) By definition of restriction, the collection \(\{\, K \leq L \mid K \to_{\mathcal{O}|_H} L \,\}\) coincides with \(\{\, K \leq L \mid K \to_{\mathcal{O}} L \,\}\) whenever \(L \leq H\), so the defining intersections agree. \(\square\)

**Lemma 5.3** (Monotonicity and an orbit-count estimate). *For the above transfer system let \(K \leq H \leq G\).*

1. *One has \(K_{\mathcal{O}} \leq K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\) and hence \(d_K \geq [K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\).*

2. *The number of \(K\)-orbits in \(H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\) satisfies*

\[
\bigl|K \backslash H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| = \frac{|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}|}{|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}|} \geq \frac{d_H}{d_K}.
\]

**Proof.** (1) By the restriction axiom for transfer systems, from \(H_{\mathcal{O}} \to H\) we obtain \(K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}} \to K\). Since \(K_{\mathcal{O}}\) is the smallest subgroup in \(\mathcal{O}_K\) (by the same construction (22) applied to \(K\)), we have \(K_{\mathcal{O}} \leq K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\). Taking indices gives \(d_K = [K : K_{\mathcal{O}}] \geq [K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\).

(2) Because \(H_{\mathcal{O}} \unlhd H\), the stabilizer in \(K\) of any coset in \(H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\) is exactly \(K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}\). Hence every \(K\)-orbit has cardinality \([K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}]\), so

\[
\bigl|K \backslash H/H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| = \frac{|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}|}{|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}|}.
\]

The inequality follows from (1): \(|K : K \cap H_{\mathcal{O}}| \leq d_K\) and \(|H : H_{\mathcal{O}}| = d_H\). \(\square\)

**The \(\mathcal{O}\)-adapted (regular) slice filtration.** For each integer \(n\) define \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subset \operatorname{Sp}^G\) to be the localizing subcategory generated by the \(\mathcal{O}\)*-slice cells*

\[
G_+ \wedge_H S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} \qquad (H \leq G,\; m \in \mathbb{Z},\; md_H \geq n). \tag{23}
\]

Here \(S^V\) denotes the representation sphere of a (virtual) real \(H\)-representation \(V\); for \(m < 0\) the notation means the corresponding desuspension by the virtual representation \(m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}\). The full subcategories \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) form a decreasing filtration of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\); in what follows we only use these subcategories themselves.

We will use the following (well-known) result.

**Lemma 5.4** (Geometric fixed points detect equivalences). *A map \(f \colon X \to Y\) in \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\) is an equivalence if and only if \(\Phi^H(f)\) is an equivalence of spectra for every subgroup \(H \leq G\).*

**Proof.** Only the "if" direction needs proof. Let \(F := \operatorname{fib}(f)\). Since each \(\Phi^H\) is exact, \(\Phi^H(F) \simeq \operatorname{fib}(\Phi^H(f)) \simeq 0\) for all \(H \leq G\). By [3, Prop. 2.52], this implies \(F \simeq 0\), hence \(f\) is an equivalence.

\(\square\)

**The fixed-point characterization of \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice connectivity.**

**Theorem 5.5.** *Let \(X\) be a connective \(G\)-spectrum and let \(n \geq 0\). Then*

\[
X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \iff \Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil} \text{ for every } H \leq G. \tag{24}
\]

**Proof.** Set

\[
\mathcal{P}_n(G) := \bigl\{\, Y \in \operatorname{Sp}^G \bigm| \Phi^H(Y) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil} \text{ for all } H \leq G \,\bigr\}.
\]

Because each \(\Phi^H\) is exact and preserves coproducts, and each \(\operatorname{Sp}_{\geq k}\) is localizing in \(\operatorname{Sp}\), the class \(\mathcal{P}_n(G)\) is a localizing subcategory of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\).

*Step 1:* \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq \mathcal{P}_n(G)\). Since \(\mathcal{P}_n(G)\) is localizing, it suffices to check the generators (23). Fix a generator

\[
Y = G_+ \wedge_H S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} \quad \text{with} \quad md_H \geq n.
\]

Because \(n \geq 0\) and \(d_H \geq 1\), this forces \(m \geq 0\).

Fix \(K \leq G\). A standard double-coset formula for geometric fixed points of induced spectra (see e.g. [3, Prop. 2.46]) gives an equivalence

\[
\Phi^K(G_+ \wedge_H Z) \;\simeq\; \bigvee_{\substack{[g] \in K \backslash G / H \\ K^g \leq H}} \Sigma^\infty(W_G K / W_H K^g)_+ \;\wedge\; \Phi^{K^g}(Z), \tag{25}
\]

natural in the \(H\)-spectrum \(Z\), where \(K^g := g^{-1}Kg\) and \(W_L M = N_L(M)/M\) denotes the Weyl group (the subgroup \(W_H K^g\) is viewed inside \(W_G K\) by conjugation with \(g\)). Applying this with \(Z = S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}\) and using that geometric fixed points of a representation sphere are the sphere of the fixed subrepresentation,

\[
\Phi^{K^g}(S^{m\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\simeq\; S^{m(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}},
\]

we obtain

\[
\Phi^K(Y) \;\simeq\; \bigvee_{\substack{[g] \in K \backslash G / H \\ K^g \leq H}} \Sigma^\infty(W_G K / W_H K^g)_+ \;\wedge\; S^{m(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}}.
\]

If the indexing set is empty then this wedge is the zero spectrum (and hence is connective in every degree), so there is nothing to prove. Otherwise smashing with \(\Sigma^\infty\) of a finite set merely produces a finite wedge of the same sphere, and it remains to understand the dimension of \((\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}\). Since \(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathbb{R}[H/H_{\mathcal{O}}]\) is a permutation representation, the fixed subspace has dimension equal to the number of orbits:

\[
\dim\bigl((\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}})^{K^g}\bigr) = \bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr|.
\]

Because \(K^g \leq H\), Lemma 5.3(2) applied to \(K^g \leq H\) gives

\[
\bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| \;\geq\; \frac{d_H}{d_{K^g}}.
\]

By Lemma 5.2(1) we have \(d_{K^g} = d_K\), hence

\[
\bigl|K^g \backslash H / H_{\mathcal{O}}\bigr| \;\geq\; \frac{d_H}{d_K}.
\]

Therefore every sphere summand has dimension at least \(m(d_H/d_K) \geq n/d_K\), hence at least \(\lceil n/d_K \rceil\) since it is integral. Thus \(\Phi^K(Y) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_K \rceil}\) for all \(K\), so \(Y \in \mathcal{P}_n(G)\), and \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq \mathcal{P}_n(G)\) follows.

*Step 2:* \(\mathcal{P}_n(G) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). We prove this by induction on \(|G|\). When \(G = e\), we have \(d_e = 1\) and

\[
\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} = \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq n \,\rangle = \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq n}
\]

by Lemma 5.1, so the claim is the ordinary Postnikov connectivity statement.

Assume now \(G \neq e\) and that the statement holds for all proper subgroups of \(G\) (with the restricted transfer system). Let \(X\) be connective and assume \(X \in \mathcal{P}_n(G)\), i.e. \(\Phi^H(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_H \rceil}\) for all \(H \leq G\).

Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of proper subgroups of \(G\) and consider isotropy separation:

\[
E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X. \tag{26}
\]

*Step 2a:* \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). For each proper \(H < G\), the restricted \(H\)-spectrum \(\operatorname{res}_H^G X\) is connective and satisfies the same geometric fixed-point bounds for all \(L \leq H\):

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G X) \simeq \Phi^L(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_L \rceil}.
\]

Here \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\) denotes the filtration for the restricted transfer system \(\mathcal{O}|_H\); by Lemma 5.2(2) the subgroups \(L_{\mathcal{O}|_H}\) (and hence the integers \(d_L\)) agree with those computed in \(G\) for all \(L \leq H\). Therefore the inductive hypothesis applies and gives

\[
\operatorname{res}_H^G X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H).
\]

A \(G\)-CW filtration of \(E\mathcal{F}\) has cells \(G/H \times D^r\) with \(H \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(r \geq 0\). Smashing with \(X\), the successive cofibres in the skeletal filtration are wedges of spectra

\[
G/H_+ \wedge S^r \wedge X \;\simeq\; G_+ \wedge_H \Sigma^r(\operatorname{res}_H^G X).
\]

Induction \(G_+ \wedge_H (-)\) is exact and preserves coproducts, hence sends localizing subcategories to localizing subcategories; moreover it sends each \(\mathcal{O}|_H\)-slice cell \(H_+ \wedge_L S^{m\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H}}\) (with \(L \leq H\)) to the corresponding \(\mathcal{O}\)-slice cell \(G_+ \wedge_L S^{m\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}}}\) (using Lemma 5.2(2) to identify \(\rho_L^{\mathcal{O}|_H} = \rho_L^{\mathcal{O}}\)). Thus

\[
G_+ \wedge_H \bigl(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\bigr) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G).
\]

Since suspension preserves \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), each skeletal stage of \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X\) lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). Finally, \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) is closed under sequential homotopy colimits (mapping telescopes) because it is closed under coproducts and cofibres; hence the colimit \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X\) lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).

*Step 2b:* \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). Set \(Z := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X\). Then \(Z\) is concentrated over \(G\):

\[
\Phi^H(Z) \simeq 0 \quad (H < G), \qquad \Phi^G(Z) \simeq \Phi^G(X).
\]

Let \(c := \lceil n/d_G \rceil \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\). By assumption \(\Phi^G(X) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\), hence \(\Phi^G(Z) \in \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq c}\). By Lemma 5.1, this implies

\[
\Phi^G(Z) \;\in\; \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}}\langle\, S^m \mid m \geq c \,\rangle. \tag{27}
\]

Consider the exact functor

\[
L \colon \operatorname{Sp} \to \operatorname{Sp}^G, \qquad L(W) := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W,
\]

where \(\epsilon^*\) denotes the trivial \(G\)-action. The spectrum \(L(W)\) is concentrated over \(G\) and satisfies \(\Phi^G(L(W)) \simeq W\).

**Lemma 5.6** (Spectra concentrated over \(G\)). *Let \(\mathcal{C} \subset \operatorname{Sp}^G\) be the full subcategory of \(G\)-spectra \(T\) such that \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge T \simeq 0\) (equivalently \(\Phi^H(T) \simeq 0\) for every proper subgroup \(H < G\)). Then*

\[
\Phi^G \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \operatorname{Sp}
\]

*is an equivalence and a quasi-inverse is \(L(W) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W\). In particular, for every \(Z \in \mathcal{C}\) there is a natural map*

\[
\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^*(\Phi^G Z) \longrightarrow Z
\]

*which is an equivalence.*

**Proof.** We shall use two standard pieces of equivariant stable homotopy theory. First, smashing with \(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}\) is a smashing Bousfield localization of \(\operatorname{Sp}^G\): its local objects are precisely the spectra \(T\) with \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge T \simeq 0\), and the functor \(L_{\mathcal{F}}(Y) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge Y\) is left adjoint to the inclusion of this full subcategory (for example [4, \(\S\)3.3]). Secondly, for a finite group the geometric fixed point functors are exact, preserve arbitrary homotopy colimits and are strong symmetric monoidal, and for a suspension spectrum one has \(\Phi^H(\Sigma^\infty A) \simeq \Sigma^\infty(A^H)\); we refer to [5, \(\S\)V.4] (see also [3, \(\S\)2]).

Let us first check that the two descriptions of \(\mathcal{C}\) agree. If \(T \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge T\), then for every proper \(H < G\) the preceding properties give \(\Phi^H(T) \simeq \Phi^H(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}) \wedge \Phi^H(T) \simeq 0\). Conversely, if all these proper geometric fixed points vanish, the map \(T \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge T\) in the isotropy-separation cofibre sequence is an equivalence after applying every \(\Phi^H\) (for \(H = G\) because \(\Phi^G(E\mathcal{F}_+) \simeq 0\)), and hence is an equivalence by Lemma 5.4. Thus \(\mathcal{C}\) is exactly the local subcategory for this smashing localization.

Put \(L(W) = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^* W\). If \(X \in \mathcal{C}\), the localization adjunction and the ordinary adjunction \(\epsilon^* \dashv (-)^G_{\mathrm{cat}}\) for categorical fixed points give natural isomorphisms of morphism sets

\[
[\, L(W),\, X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}^G} \;\cong\; [\, \epsilon^* W,\, X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}^G} \;\cong\; [\, W,\, X^G_{\mathrm{cat}} \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}} \;=\; [\, W,\, \Phi^G X \,]_{\operatorname{Sp}}, \tag{28}
\]

where in the last step we used \(X \simeq \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge X\). Hence \(L \colon \operatorname{Sp} \to \mathcal{C}\) is left adjoint to the restricted functor \(\Phi^G\).

The unit of this adjunction is an isomorphism. Indeed the monoidality just recalled and the calculation of the geometric fixed points of the universal spaces give natural equivalences

\[
\Phi^G L(W) \;\simeq\; \Phi^G(\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}) \wedge \Phi^G(\epsilon^* W) \;\simeq\; S^0 \wedge W \;\simeq\; W.
\]

For the second equivalence note that the exact coproduct-preserving functor \(\Phi^G \epsilon^*\) agrees with the identity on all suspension spheres, and hence on all spectra by the universal property of the stable homotopy category. Under these identifications the adjunction unit is the inverse equivalence: for \(W = S^0\) it is induced by the collapse map \(S^0 \to \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F}\) (after applying \(\Phi^G\)), and since both functors are exact and preserve arbitrary coproducts while \(S^0\) is a compact generator of \(\operatorname{Sp}\), the unit is an isomorphism for every \(W\). By the triangular identity for the adjunction (28), the counit

\[
\epsilon_X \colon \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge \epsilon^*(\Phi^G X) \longrightarrow X, \qquad X \in \mathcal{C},
\]

therefore becomes an equivalence after applying \(\Phi^G\). For a proper subgroup both source and target have trivial geometric fixed points, so Lemma 5.4 shows that \(\epsilon_X\) itself is an equivalence. This counit is the displayed natural map and the two functors are quasi-inverse equivalences. \(\square\)

Applying \(L\) to (27) and using exactness and coproduct preservation, we obtain

\[
Z \simeq L(\Phi^G Z) \;\in\; \operatorname{Loc}_{\operatorname{Sp}^G}\langle\, L(S^m) \mid m \geq c \,\rangle. \tag{29}
\]

Thus it suffices to show \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) for every \(m \geq c\).

**Claim 5.7.** *If \(m \geq 0\) and \(md_G \geq n\), then \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).*

**Proof.** The generator \(S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\) belongs to \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) by definition since \(md_G \geq n\).

We first show \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). For a proper subgroup \(H < G\), the restricted \(H\)-spectrum \(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\) is connective and, for \(L \leq H\),

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\simeq\; S^{m(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^L}.
\]

Since \(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathbb{R}[G/G_{\mathcal{O}}]\) is a permutation representation, \(\dim((\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^L) = |L \backslash G / G_{\mathcal{O}}|\), and Lemma 5.3(2) (with \(H = G\)) yields \(|L \backslash G / G_{\mathcal{O}}| \geq d_G / d_L\). Hence

\[
\Phi^L(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}) \;\in\; \operatorname{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/d_L \rceil}.
\]

By the inductive hypothesis applied to the group \(H\) (with the restricted transfer system, and using Lemma 5.2(2) to identify the same \(d_L\)), we conclude \(\operatorname{res}_H^G S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^H)\) for all proper \(H < G\). The same \(G\)-CW cellular argument as in Step 2a (using exactness/coproduct preservation of induction and closure under sequential homotopy colimits) then shows \(E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}(\operatorname{Sp}^G)\).

Now in the cofiber sequence

\[
E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \longrightarrow S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \longrightarrow \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}},
\]

the first two terms lie in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), so the third term does as well:

\[
\widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}. \tag{30}
\]

Set \(Z_0 := \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}\). Then \(Z_0\) is concentrated over \(G\), so \(\Phi^H(Z_0) \simeq 0\) for every proper subgroup \(H < G\), while

\[
\Phi^G(Z_0) \simeq S^{m(\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G} \simeq S^m,
\]

since \((\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}})^G \cong \mathbb{R}\) (constant functions on \(G/G_{\mathcal{O}}\)). Therefore Lemma 5.6 (applied to \(Z_0 \in \mathcal{C}\)) supplies a natural equivalence

\[
L(S^m) = L(\Phi^G Z_0) \xrightarrow{\;\simeq\;} Z_0 = \widetilde{E}\mathcal{F} \wedge S^{m\rho_G^{\mathcal{O}}}.
\]

Since the right-hand side lies in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) by (30), and \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) is closed under equivalences, it follows that \(L(S^m) \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\). \(\square\)

Now if \(m \geq c = \lceil n/d_G \rceil\), then \(m \geq 0\) and \(md_G \geq n\), so Claim 5.7 applies. Therefore all generators in (29) lie in \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), hence \(Z \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\).

*Step 2c: conclude.* In (26), both end terms lie in the localizing subcategory \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\), which is closed under extensions, hence \(X \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\).

Combining Steps 1 and 2 proves (24). \(\square\)

**Remark 5.8** (Two extremes). If \(\mathcal{O}\) allows all transfers, then \(H_{\mathcal{O}} = e\) and \(d_H = |H|\), and Theorem 5.5 recovers the usual regular slice-connectivity criterion. If \(\mathcal{O}\) only allows trivial transfers, then \(H_{\mathcal{O}} = H\) and \(d_H = 1\) for all \(H\), and the filtration \(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}\) reduces to the ordinary Postnikov filtration.
