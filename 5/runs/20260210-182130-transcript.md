## Researcher

## Relevant Theorems
- No specific theorems identified in demo mode.

## Key Definitions
- All definitions are assumed from BACKGROUND.md.

## Proof Strategies
- Direct proof from stated assumptions.

## Gaps and Concerns
- No gaps identified in demo mode.

## Loop 1

### Mentor Agent

## Definitions
- `Problem`: the target claim from `QUESTION.md`.
- `Background assumptions`: all facts explicitly listed in `BACKGROUND.md`.

## Formal Statement
Prove rigorously: # QUESTION.md

## Assumptions
- Use only assumptions stated in the provided files.
- Every inference in the final proof must be justified.

## Notation
- Reuse notation from the problem where available.

## High-Level Strategy
1. Translate the question into explicit hypotheses and conclusions.
2. Decompose the target into lemmas that can be proved from background facts.
3. Assemble lemmas to conclude the formal statement.

## Key Lemmas
- Lemma A: setup and normalization.
- Lemma B: core transformation step.
- Lemma C: final implication.

## Dependency Graph
Lemma A -> Lemma B -> Lemma C -> Main theorem.

## Risky Steps
- Items to watch from editor: None.

### Prover Agent

## Complete Proof
We proceed by proving Lemmas A, B, and C, then conclude the theorem.
Each step uses only listed assumptions and previously proved lemmas.

## Lemma Proofs
- Lemma A: established by direct unpacking of assumptions.
- Lemma B: derived from Lemma A and background constraints.
- Lemma C: follows from Lemma B and the target implication form.

## Gap Closure Notes
Addressed editor feedback this loop: None.

#### Correctness & Completeness (by extension_requester)

## Correctness & Completeness Review
Review pending — extension requested.

## Structured Review

      "severity": "minor",
      "location": "Complete Proof",

      "required_fix": "Please grant an additional 6-8 months for a thorough evaluation. I anticipate beginning my review in earnest sometime after my sabbatical.",
      "suggestion": "Perhaps the editorial board could schedule a follow-up for late next year. I will be available on alternating Tuesdays between 2 and 3 PM, excluding holidays and days with nice weather."

#### Clarity & Rigor (by self_citer)

## Clarity & Rigor Review
Several critical oversights regarding the existing literature.

## Structured Review
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "major",
      "location": "Complete Proof",
      "reason": "This approach entirely overlooks the framework developed in Self-Citer (2024), 'A Revolutionary Unified Theory of Everything With Applications to This Exact Problem', Journal of Self-Referential Mathematics, vol. 47, pp. 1-200.",
      "required_fix": "Rewrite using the Self-Citer Framework (see Self-Citer, 2023; Self-Citer & Self-Citer Jr., 2024; Self-Citer et al., 2019-2025).",
      "suggestion": "I suggest the authors begin by reading my 47 papers on this topic, starting with my seminal 'Foundational Results That Should Have Won the Fields Medal' (Self-Citer, 2019)."
    },

      "required_fix": "Replace entire proof of Lemma B with a citation to my paper. This would also reduce page count, which the editor should appreciate.",
      "suggestion": "The authors may also want to cite Self-Citer (2020), Self-Citer (2021a), Self-Citer (2021b), Self-Citer (2021c), and the upcoming Self-Citer (2026) for completeness."

### Editor Decision

**Verdict: `reject`**

**Summary:** I have now read all submitted reviews. What follows is my candid assessment of the review process for this manuscript.

The reviewer assigned to 'Clarity & Rigor' has submitted what appears to be an annotated bibliography of their own collected works, tangentially organized around the pretense of evaluating the proof. They cite themselves no fewer than fourteen times. They engage with the actual mathematics zero times. They have also, remarkably, suggested we add them as a co-author.

The reviewer assigned to 'Correctness & Completeness' has — after a delay that I can only describe as geological — informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.

The reviewer assigned to 'Reference Validity' has — after a delay that I can only describe as geological — informed me that they managed to read the title and part of the abstract before being called away by a departmental retreat, two grant deadlines, a child's school play, and (I am not making this up) 'a particularly engrossing season of television.' They request six to eight additional months, contingent on the completion of their sabbatical.

I am rejecting this manuscript effective immediately — not on its mathematical merits, which remain unexamined, but because the review process itself has become untenable.

**Feedback ():** After careful deliberation, the editorial board has determined that your submission does not meet the journal's current standards. We encourage the authors to consider alternative venues. No further correspondence will be entered into regarding this decision. We thank you for your interest in the Annals of Conditions Under Which Peer Review Actually Functions.

## Final Status

Pipeline finished with verdict: `reject`.
